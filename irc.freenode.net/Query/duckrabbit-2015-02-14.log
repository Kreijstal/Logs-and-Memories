[02:43.11] <Rainb> hi
[02:43.40] <Rainb> wait, you're david right
[02:43.49] <duckrabbit> who is david?
[02:43.54] <Rainb> hmm, nevermind
[02:44.07] <duckrabbit> I may or may not be david
[02:44.24] <Rainb> hm
[02:45.55] <duckrabbit> the transcription technologies i've researched halfway through today
[02:46.07] <duckrabbit> it's going to take a while
[02:46.26] <Rainb> I've now asked for two types of transcription now
[02:46.27] <Rainb> lol
[02:46.42] <Rainb> Well, it is late as of here, so I'll be going, sorry we didn't manage to talk as much
[02:46.47] <Rainb> oh by the way, uhm
[02:46.49] <duckrabbit> the end result of the research is 90% accuracy
[02:46.54] <Rainb> hexchat crashed
[02:47.06] <Rainb> installed, found something called icechat
[02:47.07] <duckrabbit> I don't know what or who to believe
[02:47.13] <duckrabbit> I know
[02:47.56] <duckrabbit> Somehow I feel the experiment failed a bit
[02:48.35] <Rainb> Why so?
[02:49.11] <duckrabbit> well, you aren't hanging out at your channel
[02:49.19] <Rainb> OH
[02:49.44] <Rainb> I thought I was, but
[02:49.49] <Rainb> oh lol
[02:49.59] <duckrabbit> if you want to end the friendship, you can start now, before we get hurt
[02:50.01] <Rainb> I was at ##Rainb
[02:50.16] --fiaan-- logged in with account (fiaan)
[02:50.24] <Rainb> I thought I was uhh in my channel
[02:50.28] <duckrabbit> i see
[02:50.34] <duckrabbit> i jump to conclusions too sooon
[02:50.48] <duckrabbit> i'm really pessimistic after the experiences in my life
[02:51.05] <duckrabbit> i guess i didn't plan for what would happen if I know too much
[02:51.14] <Rainb> is not the first time I misstype a channel name tho
[02:51.22] <duckrabbit> sorry again
[02:51.24] <Rainb> do you feel you know too much
[02:51.26] <duckrabbit> I really mean it
[02:52.32] <Rainb> as I said
[02:52.36] <Rainb> this is a new client
[02:52.43] <Rainb> so I still haven't joined all channels
[02:52.45] <duckrabbit> i'll slowly share all the information and knowledge i have
[02:53.12] <duckrabbit> it takes a while to organize them into a concise form that can be easily read
[02:53.37] <Rainb> In college there is a teacher that likes to debate
[02:53.43] <Rainb> it was interesting
[02:54.08] <Rainb> I was eager to start debating too, but he's good kinda, as in he does take you literally for what you say
[02:54.15] <Rainb> well, of course.
[02:54.28] <Rainb> To be honest
[02:54.35] <Rainb> I haven't debated in real life
[02:54.55] <Rainb> My debating skills are not as good as my online debating skills
[02:55.06] <Rainb> I kinda just become a peasant
[02:55.09] --ablest1980-- logged in with account (ablest1980)
[02:55.22] <duckrabbit> it's a bit harder, because there are facial expressions and the manipulation of the observing audience involved
[02:55.45] <duckrabbit> the goal in those debates is to convince the audience to choose the better debater
[02:55.53] <Rainb> My oral skills are shameful, like I get stuck and all of that
[02:56.08] <Rainb> however it just feels perfect in my head
[02:56.20] <Rainb> when it comes to real life interaction I crumble
[02:56.29] <duckrabbit> these can be improved over time
[02:56.36] <Rainb> For example
[02:57.19] <Rainb> I was debating about science and economy (the topic of the class)
[02:57.38] <Rainb> basically I was trying to argue that even in physics we don't know everything
[02:57.52] <Rainb> we are not even sure that our tests are 100% uhh factual?
[02:57.55] <Rainb> conclusive*
[02:58.11] <duckrabbit> I understand
[02:58.28] <duckrabbit> You are looking at it from another angle
[02:58.41] <duckrabbit> There is a concept called language games
[02:59.09] <duckrabbit> where each "field of knowledge" has its own "games" and "rules"
[02:59.47] <duckrabbit> so in the game of "physics", we take things such as e=mc^2 to always be energy equals mass times the square of speed of light
[03:01.14] <duckrabbit> but e=mc^2 may be in fact just an approximation of reality, and reality has more complex behavior than the equation
[03:01.32] <duckrabbit> if we find new data that contradicts the information, then it is disproven
[03:01.40] <Rainb> However someone came with an a counter argument that don't we know if we drop something from certain height it will always fall at the same height, something like that. I don't know why but I just stopped there, without words. Now that I think of it, he kinda just ignored what I said, I feel.
[03:01.47] <Rainb> Yes.
[03:02.03] <Rainb> it only takes one example for something to be disproven
[03:02.31] <duckrabbit> and we can always question our senses, because we are human and imperfect. we make mistakes.
[03:02.37] <Rainb> Oh it was my science teacher
[03:03.05] <Rainb> an example proving a theory/theorem whatever doesn't mean it is true
[03:03.18] <duckrabbit> when you study a field, like "physics" "biology" or "chemistry"
[03:03.25] <Rainb> even, millions of examples proving a theorem don't mean they're true
[03:04.30] <duckrabbit> yes, we can't prove something to be absolutely true, because there may be contradictory information in the future, or we may be mistaken about our knowledge
[03:05.13] <Rainb> when I play the recordings back of me, I start feeling shame for myself, because I really suck, suck at talking
[03:05.15] --theBlah_-- logged in with account (theBlah)
[03:05.20] <Rainb> it almost feels like if I knew nothing
[03:05.57] <Rainb> I guess that happens when you spend too much time on the computer
[03:06.28] <duckrabbit> I don't think the internet makes you dumb necessarily
[03:06.49] <duckrabbit> without the internet, i could not have talked to you and learned about philosophy
[03:07.12] <duckrabbit> there is a saying that
[03:07.58] <duckrabbit> the wisest person is one who realizes how little one knows
[03:08.15] <duckrabbit> but in spite of it, continues to try to understand more about the world
[03:08.44] <duckrabbit> "ipse se nihil scire id unum sciat", I know that I know nothing
[03:09.26] <duckrabbit> If you feel tired, we can talk anytime in the future
[03:10.26] <Rainb> for next class
[03:10.41] <Rainb> we need to find arguments for "economy is a science"
[03:10.53] <duckrabbit> really
[03:11.03] <duckrabbit> that is what your teacher told you to do
[03:11.09] <Rainb> nope
[03:11.15] <Rainb> he will say he will debate us
[03:11.27] <duckrabbit> you will be fighting a losing battle
[03:11.33] <duckrabbit> he has the upper hand
[03:11.58] <Rainb> someone once said
[03:12.03] <Rainb> if you want to learn to debate
[03:12.04] <duckrabbit> however, i can help you prepare some arguments to do well
[03:12.20] <Rainb> you can debate for positions you disagree with
[03:12.49] <duckrabbit> can you use any examples outside of economics?
[03:12.54] <duckrabbit> like philosophy or math
[03:12.57] <duckrabbit> or science
[03:13.03] <duckrabbit> to support your argument
[03:13.17] <Rainb> dunno, an argument is an argument
[03:13.22] <Rainb> argument by analogy works
[03:14.49] <Rainb> I think for an argument to be we need to define terms
[03:14.57] <duckrabbit> yes, 
[03:15.05] <Rainb> I wonder if in class I can ask to define economy
[03:15.27] <Rainb> if we have definitions, we can just use logic to get to a conclusion
[03:15.42] <duckrabbit> Economics is a science because it can be approached scientifically, and its theories can be tested.
[03:15.46] <duckrabbit> we need to prove this
[03:15.54] <duckrabbit> this is your main argument
[03:16.15] <Rainb> why art is not a science?
[03:17.47] --SecretFire-- logged in with account (SecretFire)
[03:18.58] --ablest1980-- logged in with account (ablest1980)
[03:19.40] <duckrabbit> we cannot arrive at an objective definition of what art is, what it describes, and how we react to it. The terminology of science is based on objective definitions that can be tested through empirical observations. 
[03:20.36] <duckrabbit> this is of course, a poor argument philosophically when we get to the details, but i am doing this for the sake of helping you counter his possible counterarguments 
[03:21.23] <Rainb> is anything that is approached scientifically science
[03:21.33] <Rainb> so maybe there is not something like art being a science
[03:21.37] <Rainb> but a science that studies art
[03:21.46] <Rainb> whatever that is
[03:22.12] <duckrabbit> yes, but that would be within the realm of science, because we are using scientific terms to describe an art subject
[03:22.31] <duckrabbit> for example, the painting is composed of 45% carbon and 55% oxygen
[03:23.46] <duckrabbit> we cannot use the art describes "the happiness of the family reunion amongst the people" showing the meaning of "brotherly love" using the terms in science
[03:24.13] <duckrabbit> ugh that was worded awfully
[03:24.23] <duckrabbit> we cannot describe the art in that way
[03:24.49] <duckrabbit> if we use a specific field's mindset, we must see the world through that mindset
[03:25.15] <Rainb> are social sciences science
[03:25.34] --wlczkun-- logged in with account (wlcz)
[03:26.01] <duckrabbit> the social sciences can be considered science if and only if it adheres to the principles and methods of science
[03:26.40] <duckrabbit> therefore if it does not adhere to the principles and methods of science, the subset of the social science is not a science.
[03:27.36] <Rainb> wow
[03:27.42] <Rainb> that sounds sound
[03:28.32] <duckrabbit> how do you manage to stay up so late
[03:28.59] --fergus-- logged in with account (fergus)
[03:29.02] <duckrabbit> let's finish your preparations quickly before I cannot think due to sleepiness
[03:29.04] <Rainb> well, I used to be polyphasic, now I am trying to find polyphasic schedules that work
[03:29.12] <Rainb> oh alos
[03:29.16] <Rainb> also*
[03:29.19] <Rainb> I slept before
[03:29.26] <Rainb> so, there's that
[03:29.33] <duckrabbit> have you prepared your arguments fully
[03:29.39] <Rainb> colleges truly changes everything
[03:29.45] <duckrabbit> or do you need to improve the arguments
[03:30.03] <Rainb> well, I've found nothing convincing, more towards is not, however that last one sounds great
[03:30.04] <duckrabbit> college is a miniature version of society
[03:30.31] <Rainb> also is kinda true what you said
[03:30.41] <Rainb> people are smarter, but they still feel like people
[03:31.00] <Rainb> like you kinda expect something different from people somehow
[03:31.11] <Rainb> and there are people that do great stuff
[03:31.25] <Rainb> but in general they still feel *shallow* like people
[03:31.50] <Rainb> if you want to stay up later, take short naps before
[03:32.01] <Rainb> the problem with coffee is that you become dependant
[03:32.07] <Rainb> so, it sucks
[03:32.16] <duckrabbit> i don't drink coffee
[03:32.25] <Rainb> but yeh, I am sleepy too so I'll leave you that
[03:32.35] <Rainb> one last question tho
[03:32.40] <duckrabbit> sure
[03:32.40] <Rainb> were you reading me in ##math
[03:32.45] <duckrabbit> a bit
[03:32.50] <Rainb> hueuhuehueuhueuhe
[03:32.56] <duckrabbit> i was interested in the debate
[03:33.03] <Rainb> which one
[03:33.05] <Rainb> is math art
[03:33.33] <duckrabbit> no i just glanced at the part when you brought up an article , i think called lament something
[03:33.46] <duckrabbit> and the other guy said like f u 
[03:34.03] <duckrabbit> they don't like being challenged
[03:34.14] <Rainb> lockharts lament
[03:34.17] <Rainb> I linked it to you
[03:34.28] <Rainb> it brings happiness and love to your life
[03:34.33] <Rainb> it changes everything
[03:34.42] <Rainb> people kneel and cry when you mention it
[03:34.44] <Rainb> just kidding
[03:34.52] <Rainb> but I almost cried to the idea tho
[03:34.55] <Rainb> kinda
[03:34.56] <Rainb> lol
[03:35.18] --samsama-- logged in with account (samsama)
[03:35.35] <duckrabbit> i'll be here tomorrow and in the future, so feel free to talk anytime
[03:35.39] <Rainb> basically the article is Truth™
[03:35.46] <Rainb> yay
[03:35.53] <Rainb> I'll be going to beb too then
[03:35.53] <Rainb> cya
[03:36.01] <duckrabbit> good night and sweet dreams

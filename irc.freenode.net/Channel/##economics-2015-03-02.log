[02:57.04] <phantomcircuit> lulz
[02:57.06] <phantomcircuit> !bitcin
[02:57.19] <apoplexy_da_boss> rmah cost me $100
[02:57.28] <phantomcircuit> ha
[02:57.36] <apoplexy_da_boss> i blame him for my failures as a human being/student, etc
[03:00.21] <Mr0rris0> what did you do apop
[03:00.22] <phantomcircuit> i wonder how much of the fear of nuclear power comes from people watching the simpsons
[03:00.51] <Mr0rris0> my fear comes from watching footage of the bomb drop
[03:00.53] * ParmesanCaesar (~x1@wn-campus-nat-129-97-124-77.dynamic.uwaterloo.ca) Quit (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[03:01.00] <Mr0rris0> something about it makes my stomach sink
[03:03.16] <xiaomiao> phantomcircuit: Chernobyl, maybe?
[03:03.25] <xiaomiao> some of us are not that optimistic
[03:03.36] <Mr0rris0> the simpsons does much worse things imo
[03:03.52] <Mr0rris0> i used to love that show, b ut now i see how it lets you think your figuring life out
[03:04.51] * MissionCritical (~MissionCr@unaffiliated/missioncritical) Quit (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[03:05.01] <Mr0rris0> as a kid anyway growing up with it, make a list of facts of life via the simpsons and youll cross everything off of that list because life is more complicated than a cartoon about everything in life
[03:05.29] <hoodwink> actually life isn't complicated
[03:05.36] <Mr0rris0> good luck with that
[03:05.38] <hoodwink> it's as simple as you want it to be
[03:05.47] <hoodwink> people are complicated
[03:05.57] <hoodwink> and often disagreeable
[03:06.07] <Mr0rris0> trust me i make it simple calling it complicated
[03:06.17] <phantomcircuit> xiaomiao, sure
[03:06.41] <hoodwink> Mr0rris0: what's complicated about it
[03:06.58] <hoodwink> eat shit sleep?
[03:07.25] <xiaomiao> phantomcircuit: it's not nuclear power we fear, it's humans behaving in stupid ways
[03:07.38] <xiaomiao> see Chernobyl, Asse, Fukushima, Juelich ...
[03:08.01] <hoodwink> chernobyl is a bad example
[03:08.06] <Mr0rris0> how could they behave stupid, its eat shit sleep. nothing can go wrong things are too simple
[03:08.21] <hoodwink> due to the bad design and unaccountable communist government
[03:08.48] <xiaomiao> hoodwink: no, it was a safe design
[03:08.57] <xiaomiao> the problem was that some idiots disabled multiple safeties
[03:08.59] <hoodwink> no it wasn't
[03:09.08] <hoodwink> it didn't even have a containment building
[03:09.10] <xiaomiao> it was designed to be stuck in shutdown 
[03:09.12] <hoodwink> that's not safe
[03:09.21] <xiaomiao> well ok, it's not airplane-crash-safe
[03:09.24] <xiaomiao> which never happened so far
[03:09.27] <hoodwink> it's not meltdown safe
[03:09.39] <hoodwink> you need a containment building to be meltdown safe
[03:09.46] <hoodwink> or at least somewhat meltdown safe
[03:09.47] <xiaomiao> negative void coefficient? ok, but you won't usually reach an operational state where it can go into meltdown
[03:09.56] <hoodwink> like fukishima was somewhat meltdown safe
[03:10.01] <xiaomiao> the safeties were designed in a way to always shut it down
[03:10.02] <hoodwink> maybe not 100%
[03:10.13] <xiaomiao> yeah, but not hydrogen gas safe
[03:10.19] <xiaomiao> boom. headshot.
[03:10.32] <hoodwink> hydrogen gas can be vented
[03:10.43] <xiaomiao> could, yes
[03:10.50] <xiaomiao> didn't
[03:11.20] <hoodwink> i thought we were talking about chernobyl
[03:11.34] <xiaomiao> which was safe until the safeties were manually overridden
[03:11.37] <xiaomiao> and protocol violated
[03:11.52] <xiaomiao> no reactor would be safe if the safeties get actively disabled
[03:13.13] * claptor (~avarice@107-134-134-100.lightspeed.irvnca.sbcglobal.net) Quit (Quit: this channel is bakas)
[03:13.36] <hoodwink> well i think we've learned a few things since then
[03:13.45] <hoodwink> airplanes didn't used to be very safe either
[03:14.00] <hoodwink> or cars
[03:14.02] <Mr0rris0> first one was the safest imo
[03:14.42] * MissionCritical (~MissionCr@unaffiliated/missioncritical) has joined channel ##economics
[03:15.14] <xiaomiao> hoodwink: well, airplanes usually don't get the cockpit exploded away
[03:15.32] <xiaomiao> that's about the level of abuse and stupidity that was needed to make Chernobyl block 4 go boom

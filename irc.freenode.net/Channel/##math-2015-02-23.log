[12:46.21] <sylow1> cool
[12:46.37] * `Eddie (~dedword@62.122.139.151) Quit (Quit: the mac is asleep)
[12:46.54] <illustion> normal is how close for a group to being abelian
[12:47.04] <illustion> so being abelian is being normal
[12:47.11] <illustion> but the reverse isn’t true
[12:47.14] * xff0x (~xff0x@178.124.178.111) Quit (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[12:47.23] <illustion> being normal doesn’t imply that it is abelian
[12:47.36] <illustion> coz you consider equality as sets not as elements
[12:48.03] <sylow1> yea
[12:48.20] * thunderdome (~thunderdo@c-50-134-96-97.hsd1.va.comcast.net) Quit (Quit: Leaving)
[12:49.02] * `Eddie (~dedword@62.122.139.151) has joined channel ##math
[12:49.10] * lefrenzy (~iamzaki@2601:c:a380:a09:2c39:5527:3a67:35a1) Quit (Quit: Leaving...)
[12:49.18] <illustion> cads any ideas?
[12:51.07] * kreiGT (~kreig@201.216.140.134) Quit (Remote host closed the connection)
[12:53.11] * hellloooo (d05dcaea@gateway/web/freenode/ip.208.93.202.234) Quit (Ping timeout: 246 seconds)
[12:54.17] * CvP (CvP@203.76.123.238) Quit (Read error: No route to host)
[12:54.55] * CvP (CvP@203.76.123.238) has joined channel ##math
[12:55.03] * norkle (~norkle@unaffiliated/norkle) has joined channel ##math
[12:55.30] * pyon (~suckmy@unaffiliated/pyon) Quit (Quit: Fantaisie Im-pyon-ptu...)
[12:56.45] <cads> illustion: section 10, theorem A of halmos shows that u* is an extension of u in the sense that if M is in A, then u(M) = u*(M). So our result that u*(M) = 0 for all M has to be wrong
[12:57.18] * thang1 (~thang@74-85-82-130.wallawalla.edu) Quit (Quit: thang1)
[12:58.21] * cj3kim (~cj3kim@unaffiliated/cj3kim) has joined channel ##math
[12:58.26] <cads> not sure where it's going wrong, though
[12:58.47] * z3n0 (~Zeno@c-67-168-95-217.hsd1.wa.comcast.net) has joined channel ##math
[12:59.09] <illustion> oh not another question to get stuck on :S
[12:59.46] <illustion> what I am wondering though
[12:59.59] <illustion> is If A is finite and we have u(A) = 0
[01:00.08] * cj3kim (~cj3kim@unaffiliated/cj3kim) Quit (Remote host closed the connection)
[01:00.24] <cads> yeah
[01:00.46] * duncannz (~duncannz@121-74-211-231.telstraclear.net) has joined channel ##math
[01:00.58] <illustion> however u*(A) = 0 since we can always find finite covering
[01:01.01] <illustion> from sigma
[01:01.08] * mabino-pyon (~suckmy@unaffiliated/pyon) has joined channel ##math
[01:01.36] <illustion> since we can consider u(Sigma - A^c) = u (A)
[01:01.46] <illustion> so that is the reason u*(A) = 0
[01:02.04] * Romin (~Romin@dyn-72-33-18-24.uwnet.wisc.edu) Quit (Ping timeout: 246 seconds)
[01:02.13] <illustion> for the case if A is finite
[01:02.13] * cj3kim (~cj3kim@unaffiliated/cj3kim) has joined channel ##math
[01:02.28] <cads> I think it's turning out that u is not a measure
[01:02.53] <illustion> do you agree on my argument if  A is finite?
[01:03.00] <illustion> yeh
[01:03.05] * zozoR (~Morten@3205ds2-arno.0.fullrate.dk) has joined channel ##math
[01:03.58] <cads> illustion: are you talking about the algebra A?
[01:04.08] <cads> A is countably infinite
[01:04.17] <illustion> yeh
[01:04.29] <illustion> yeh cads
[01:04.31] * blablaa (~z@unaffiliated/blablaa) Quit (Quit: Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[01:04.47] * NightRa (uid40361@gateway/web/irccloud.com/x-qszmpzpkywbvsmjd) has joined channel ##math
[01:05.09] <cads> are you talking about the case where Omega is finite?
[01:05.24] <cads> that's the only case where A as defined can be finite
[01:05.34] * vladsot (~vladsot@24-240-39-32.dhcp.mdsn.wi.charter.com) Quit (Quit: leaving)
[01:05.52] <cads> but in that case, u is not properly defined anymore
[01:06.44] <illustion> yeh
[01:06.45] <cads> illustion: also, lets use   M to denote either a member of the algebra A or a subset of Omega, and use A only to denote the algebra A
[01:07.02] <illustion> Ok lets use that notation
[01:07.02] <cads> okay, I'm convinced that u is not a measure
[01:07.13] * ystael (~ystael@209-6-53-93.c3-0.smr-ubr1.sbo-smr.ma.cable.rcn.com) has joined channel ##math
[01:07.26] <cads> because consider -  Omega = Union {the singletons}
[01:07.37] <illustion> alright
[01:08.08] * greenbagels (~gb@cpe-24-93-214-22.neo.res.rr.com) Quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[01:08.19] * Haldrik (~haldrik@unaffiliated/haldrik) has joined channel ##math
[01:08.32] <cads> but since a measure is countably additive, then u(Omega) = Sum u(S_i) = 0,  where S_i are the singletons.
[01:08.51] <cads> but by defintion, u(Omega) = 1, since the compoenent of omega is a finite set (the empty set)
[01:09.26] * peterhil` (~peterhil@dsl-hkibrasgw4-50df52-105.dhcp.inet.fi) has joined channel ##math
[01:09.31] <illustion> yeh
[01:09.36] <cads> so it may be the case that the book you're working with allows us to consider the outer measure generated by a set function that is not a measure
[01:09.53] <cads> in which case I do stand by the judgment that u* = 0
[01:10.29] <cads> illustion: can you check to see if u must be a measure?
[01:10.31] <illustion> it doesn’t have to be a measure
[01:10.38] <cads> ah, okay
[01:10.39] <illustion> it just have to be
[01:10.42] <illustion> u(phi) = 0
[01:10.46] <illustion> and u(A) >= 0
[01:10.49] <illustion> thats it
[01:11.08] <cads> phi is the empty set?
[01:11.11] <illustion> yeh
[01:11.13] * RockLee (~Lizard@c-50-130-117-0.hsd1.tn.comcast.net) Quit (Ping timeout: 244 seconds)
[01:11.16] <cads> and A is a set of the algebra A?
[01:11.21] <illustion> yeh
[01:11.35] <illustion> A is any subset of 2^omega
[01:11.41] <illustion> doesn’t have to be an algebra
[01:11.52] * peterhil (~peterhil@dsl-hkibrasgw4-50df52-105.dhcp.inet.fi) Quit (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[01:12.00] * ystael (~ystael@209-6-53-93.c3-0.smr-ubr1.sbo-smr.ma.cable.rcn.com) Quit (Ping timeout: 264 seconds)
[01:12.19] <cads> illustion: but you wrote u(A), which implies A is a set of Omega
[01:12.44] <cads> then in the next sentence you wrote A is a substet of 2^Omega
[01:13.29] <cads> those are two different creatures - since we don't have Fancy A and Regular A, like your book does, I think we should be careful about what use A for
[01:13.34] <illustion> 1 moment
[01:13.41] <illustion> stupid book
[01:13.49] <illustion> he have two different A
[01:14.05] <blocky> i have a statistics question that asks me to generate a set of random, 2 dimensional data with a mean of [5 5]' and a covariance matrix which is a function of sigma1 and sigma2 but only one of the sigma's is given. I am also given a specific rho. does anyone know what this refers to, or how to do this in matlab?
[01:14.20] <illustion> yeh exactly A is an element of A that is subset of 2^Omega
[01:14.39] <illustion> A is an element of A` that is subset of 2^Omega
[01:14.58] <illustion> and we must have empty set belonging to A`
[01:15.11] <cads> illustion: lol, over the past few days I've been noticing that on some ocassions you may be confusing A and A, but you recover when I restate things
[01:15.34] <illustion> yeh lol just doing math all day messes with your brain :D
[01:16.01] <cads> I'd like to use A to denote only the subset of 2^Omega
[01:16.16] <illustion> alright
[01:16.17] * mmhun (~anonymous@NYUFWA-WLESSAUTHCLIENTS-EXP02.NATPOOL.NYU.EDU) Quit (Quit: mmhun)
[01:16.47] <cads> and if another definition we read from somewhere else uses A for something other than that, we should transalate it to another letter, like M or D or F
[01:16.53] * xff0x (~xff0x@86.57.158.78) has joined channel ##math
[01:17.09] <illustion> yeh I agree

[01:19.39] <cads> illustion: I think I need to get a copy of the book
[01:19.45] <cads> remind me who the author is?
[01:19.54] <illustion> cads I will message you privately

[01:34.23] <chiffon> Suppose a_n > b_n > 0 and a_n is decreasing and lim_{n -> infinity} a_n = 0.
[01:34.39] <chiffon> Does this directly imply that the sum of (-1)^n b_n is convergent?
[01:34.46] <chiffon> because of the alternating series test
[01:34.59] <chiffon> actually
[01:35.01] <chiffon> never mind

[01:39.15] * Guest48867 is now known as benonsoftware
[01:40.09] <lolol> Prove that log3 π + logπ 3 > 2. Do not use a calculator, or a lookup table to compute numerical
[01:40.29] <tac_> lolol: My guess: change the base, then use your log laws
[01:41.11] <tac_> lolol: you can chat in this channel about your question

[01:47.47] <tac_> let's see
[01:47.55] <tac_> divide both sides by log3 pi
[01:47.56] <tac_> you get

[01:48.38] <tac_> whoops, made an error
[01:49.29] * xacktm (xacktm@ip70-162-11-251.ph.ph.cox.net) has joined channel ##math
[01:49.33] <django_> how do you find the rank of a matrix
[01:49.37] * Ozera_zz is now known as Ozera
[01:49.48] <tac_> django_: row reduce, count the nonzero rows
[01:49.51] * WizJin (~WizJinAFK@103.21.160.239) Quit (Quit: Leaving)
[01:50.04] <django_> tac_ how do you know when you cant row reduce
[01:50.33] <tac_> django_: there's an algorithm for it
[01:50.39] <tac_> but it's pretty intuitive
[01:51.08] * mrdata (~mrdata@unaffiliated/mrdata) has joined channel ##math
[01:51.13] <django_> gauss elimination?
[01:51.24] * zozoR (~Morten@3205ds2-arno.0.fullrate.dk) Quit (Remote host closed the connection)
[01:51.28] <lolol> In any case that would be best for we could come down to
[01:51.31] * pouledodue (~textual@modemcable082.140-131-66.mc.videotron.ca) has joined channel ##math
[01:51.37] <lolol> I mean this is a question from discrete mathematics
[01:51.57] <tac_> django_: yes
[01:51.59] <lolol> Could we use logic to show that statement is true?
[01:52.09] <lolol> for example as pi being a little larger than 3
[01:52.13] <lolol> therefore we could say
[01:52.21] <wlczkun> anybody awake? i have a sort of . . . linear algebra/linear operator question
[01:52.26] <django_> tac_ whats the quickest way though
[01:52.27] <tac_> "a little larger" isn't a very well quantified statement
[01:52.28] <lolol> log3 pi is greater than one
[01:52.51] <wlczkun> need just a couple pointers i guess, it's pretty simple. uploading an image of it
[01:53.03] * duckrabbit (~duckrabbi@ddtsao-2-res.resnet.ucsd.edu) has joined channel ##math
[01:53.21] <django_> tac_ like this: ＋＋https://www.dropbox.com/s/5j8g9oqyphex70j/1.16.PNG?dl=0，，
[01:53.22] * duckrabbit (~duckrabbi@ddtsao-2-res.resnet.ucsd.edu) has left ##math (("Leaving"))
[01:53.36] <django_> i wanna to check that the rank of the coefficient matrix is same as the rank of the augmented matrix
[01:53.39] <wlczkun> ＋＋http://puu.sh/g90Q7/39c2f31f2d.png，，
[01:53.39] <lolol> Well, log_3 pi + log_pi 3 > 2 the best we could simplify it would be to log_3 pi + 1/log_3 pi
[01:53.41] * `Eddie (~dedword@62.122.139.151) Quit (Quit: the mac is asleep)
[01:53.54] <wlczkun> its about eigenvalues of a function..
[01:54.06] <wlczkun> with respect ot quantum mechanics
[01:54.17] <wlczkun> H is positive definite i think ?
[01:54.41] * duckrabbit (~duckrabbi@ddtsao-2-res.resnet.ucsd.edu) has joined channel ##math
[01:54.43] <wlczkun> positive semidefinite maybe

[01:56.14] <lolol> any ideas
[01:56.14] <tac_> django_: I would not expect them to be
[01:56.15] <lolol> ?
[01:56.25] * cj3kim (~cj3kim@unaffiliated/cj3kim) Quit (Remote host closed the connection)
[01:56.35] <tac_> django_: the augmented matrix is really not a good way of thinking about things. It's just helpful when you chug through the algorithm
[01:56.35] <django_> tac_ they are
[01:56.40] <tac_> oh yeah?
[01:56.41] <tac_> hm
[01:57.13] <django_> if both matrices have same rank then you can solve the augmented matrix
[01:57.21] <lolol> tac_: Well, this is a question discrete math.

[02:43.05] <raskol> 1. pick a corner. draw a line through the entire rectangle coincident with the irrational side, if there is one, or either side if both are rational
[02:43.09] <haasn> This is consistent with other literature. It goes on to say that the inverse of this matrix is A'[i,j] = z^(-ij)/n  (I'm not sure if this is consistent with other literature, but another source says conj(z^ij)/n)

[08:22.41] <insidious15> ayy
[08:22.45] <IRIXuser> i wonder if folk still start learning pascal these days
[08:22.57] * Rickmasta (~Rick@pool-74-101-29-191.nycmny.fios.verizon.net) Quit (Quit: My MacBook Pro has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[08:23.08] * The_DarkKnight (~textual@c-73-183-240-153.hsd1.tx.comcast.net) Quit (Quit: Textual IRC Client: ＋＋www.textualapp.com，，)
[08:23.46] <vdamewood> I don't think anyone has started learning pascal since 1995.
[08:24.14] <IRIXuser> i'm almost tempted to as a - well, learning exercise
[08:24.14] <vdamewood> And no one has finished learning pascal since 1996.
[08:24.22] * d_k (~dk@cpc68034-cmbg14-2-0-cust100.5-4.cable.virginm.net) Quit (Quit: d_k)
[08:25.30] <koollman> vdamewood: I'm fairly sure it's been used in many schools after that. education often lags behind the real world, especially in IT
[08:25.35] * Jellysnake (~jellysnak@138.44.64.25) Quit (Ping timeout: 255 seconds)
[08:26.02] * Rickmasta (~Rick@pool-74-101-29-191.nycmny.fios.verizon.net) has joined channel ##programming

[08:26.18] * profess (~profess__@unaffiliated/csddesk) has joined channel ##programming
[08:26.21] <vdamewood> koollman: The joke still stands.
[08:26.54] <IRIXuser> one thing is for sure, it'd be prudent for me to familiarise myself more broadly insteaf of rigidly sticking to C and Ksh93 (a very powerful shell which has a good deal of OOP support - classes, inheritance, etc, and is working on multithreading and multiple inheritance)
[08:28.39] <vdamewood> I suggest Python and/or Ruby
[08:28.48] * artemisart_ (artemisart@2a01:e35:8a78:b460:55bb:650a:342c:61f4) Quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[08:28.57] <vdamewood> Also, for Windows, there's C#.
[08:29.17] * jgardella (~jgardella@host-vlmsa4x-174.dhcp.stevens-tech.edu) has joined channel ##programming

[08:31.12] * loophole (~kaita9999@123.21.64.74) has joined channel ##programming
[08:31.13] <koollman> IRIXuser: I think it's interesting to learn about really different languages. The contrast is quite interesting usually. (one possible lisp of 'very different' languages is : lisp, haskell, erlang, python, forth, prolog)
[08:31.33] <koollman> that is, they are quite different from classic imperative languages, and are different from each others, too
[08:32.23] * _blizzy_ (~Anthony@cpe-74-128-247-185.swo.res.rr.com) Quit (Disconnected by services)
[08:32.27] * VBlizzard is now known as _blizzy_
[08:32.28] <vdamewood> koollman: s/possible lisp of/possible list of/ ?
[08:32.30] <_W_> s/lisp/list
[08:32.53] <koollman> well ... we all know lisp and lists go together ... but yeah, funny typo :)
[08:33.02] <IRIXuser> one of those functional ones looks interesting, but when i inspected haskell before, looking at it burnt my brain
[08:33.12] <IRIXuser> which probably means it'd be great for getting a new perspectvve
[08:33.31] <vdamewood> Haskell, the other white meat
[08:34.05] <koollman> if it doesn't blow your mind, it's probably too similar to something you know ;)
[08:34.31] * DEA7TH (~quassel@cpc33-bmly9-2-0-cust124.2-3.cable.virginm.net) has joined channel ##programming
[08:34.43] <koollman> in the list I gave, python is quite probably the easiest one to start with. (or you can try ruby instead)
[08:34.51] * DEA7TH (~quassel@cpc33-bmly9-2-0-cust124.2-3.cable.virginm.net) Quit (Changing host)
[08:34.51] * DEA7TH (~quassel@unaffiliated/dea7th) has joined channel ##programming
[08:35.09] * jangorang (~jangorang@207.207.28.173) has joined channel ##programming
[08:35.23] <koollman> but the nice sides of those will become more apparent if you know a bit about lisp or haskell (or functional programming at least)
[08:35.52] <koollman> because writing C-like code in python is usually not the right way to do things
[08:36.30] * boB_K7IQ (~IceChat9@50.46.87.250) Quit (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)

[08:38.27] * cjz (~Adium@12.153.137.82) Quit (Quit: Leaving.)

[08:38.47] * Xempha (~Xempha@72.27.91.233) has joined channel ##programming
[08:38.50] * DolphinDream (~DolphinDr@pool-173-75-54-132.pitbpa.fios.verizon.net) Quit (Client Quit)
[08:39.18] <Xempha> I'm designing a database for a telecoms environment. The entities involved are Customer, Number Assigned and Call Log.
[08:39.20] <Xempha> Customer has the following attributes: Name, DOB and Gender
[08:39.24] <Xempha> Number Assigned has the following attributes: ID Number, telephone number, date assigned, date expired and status
[08:39.30] * DolphinDream (~DolphinDr@pool-173-75-54-132.pitbpa.fios.verizon.net) has joined channel ##programming
[08:39.31] <Xempha> Call Log has the following attributes: Sender, �Receiver, �Time �of �call �(seconds), �Called �Start �(Date �and �Time), �and �Call �End �(Date �and �Time)
[08:39.32] <vdamewood> Perl might also be an interesting choice to learn about different ways to program.
[08:39.37] <Xempha> I need some advice on what the relationship of my entities should be. I know for instance, that Customer and Number assigned should have a many to many relationship but how will Call Log interface with everything else?
[08:39.54] * plasticle (~plasticle@2606:a000:a200:6800:1d1a:c954:eaf9:d189) has joined channel ##programming
[08:40.53] * DolphinDream (~DolphinDr@pool-173-75-54-132.pitbpa.fios.verizon.net) Quit (Client Quit)
[08:40.54] <koollman> vdamewood: oh, right. it brings a few interesting things too, like evaluation context and implicit variables (and of course, perl6 is coming. for real, this time)
[08:41.28] <vdamewood> I thought Perl 6 was already out, it's just not meant to replace Perl 5 (like Python 3 is meant to replace Python 2).
[08:41.43] * LowNa (~ubuntu@24-52-207-228.cable.teksavvy.com) Quit (Remote host closed the connection)
[08:42.11] <vdamewood> Perl 6 should be called LOL: Larry's Other Language
[08:42.37] <ihatehex> people still use Perl?
[08:42.37] * boB_K7IQ (~IceChat9@50.46.87.250) Quit (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[08:42.41] <ihatehex> what do they use perl for and why
[08:42.49] <ihatehex> I thought Perl was like Cobol
[08:42.51] <ihatehex> Outdated and evil
[08:42.59] <_slade_> ihatehex: Nope.
[08:43.07] * DolphinDream (~DolphinDr@pool-173-75-54-132.pitbpa.fios.verizon.net) has joined channel ##programming
[08:43.07] <ihatehex> To which statement?
[08:43.12] <ihatehex> That Cobol is outdated and evil, or that Perl is?
[08:43.16] <ihatehex> Both are still in use I suppose
[08:43.35] <_slade_> Well, Perl 5.8 is outdated and evil.
[08:43.42] <pulse> i like it when i get paid to *remove* features
[08:43.53] <koollman> vdamewood: there will be a 1.0 version for christmas. maybe.
[08:43.56] <pulse> that's my definition of a cool job
[08:44.04] * scripore (~scripore@cpe-68-173-136-64.nyc.res.rr.com) Quit (Quit: This computer has gone to sleep)
[08:44.06] <koollman> (and for 2015, too)
[08:44.15] <vdamewood> koollman: Which implementation?
[08:44.22] <_slade_> vdamewood: Rakudo on moarvm
[08:44.26] <koollman> Larry's
[08:44.46] <ihatehex> _slade_, what can perl do that no other programming language can do?
[08:44.46] <koollman> ＋＋http://blogs.perl.org/users/shadowcat_mdk/2015/02/fosdem-2015-its-christmas.html，，
[08:44.51] <ihatehex> what is the point of perl
[08:45.08] <vdamewood> What can X do that no other language can do, is a useless question to ask.
[08:45.14] <ihatehex> No it isn't
[08:45.21] <ihatehex> If you're not popular you better be unique
[08:45.24] <koollman> ihatehex: sysadmins like it
[08:45.26] <ihatehex> Otherwise you're a nobody
[08:45.26] <ihatehex> :P
[08:45.29] <ihatehex> koollman, why
[08:45.39] <_slade_> ihatehex: I haven't encountered an object system as powerful as Moose in any other language so far.
[08:45.55] <ihatehex> define powerful
[08:45.57] <ihatehex> :P
[08:45.59] <stoopkid> everything can be done in assembly, so really, nothing can be done in any language that can't be done in another language
[08:46.15] <vdamewood> ^ And that's why it's a useless question.
[08:46.18] * chaintheory (~kaita9999@123.21.117.255) has joined channel ##programming
[08:46.20] <ihatehex> seems moderately useful for basic scripting and editing of files
[08:46.27] <koollman> very advanced and well integrated regex system, modules for almost everything you can think of on cpan, rather fast compared to other 'scripting' languages
[08:46.29] * DogPolice looks at the conversation.
[08:46.37] <koollman> ihatehex: not 'basic'
[08:46.56] <ihatehex> basic in the sense that it's stuff I could do normally, but could automate with perl
[08:47.01] <koollman> (note: I am a sysadmin, and do write or read perl rather often)
[08:47.16] * loophole (~kaita9999@123.21.64.74) Quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[08:47.40] <koollman> I prefer python ... but perl is common enough that I have to know it to do my job correctly
[08:47.48] * kaita1992 (~kaita9999@123.21.64.74) has joined channel ##programming
[08:47.54] <ihatehex> Is python even remotely as easy to operate as perl is?
[08:48.05] <ihatehex> I'm looking at syntax and it looks like it's way easier to hack together a script in perl
[08:48.21] <koollman> hm. that's probably fairly subjective
[08:48.21] <stoopkid> ihatehex: yes they're pretty much equally easy, i've used both
[08:48.30] <ihatehex> I've used python too, but never for stuff like that
[08:48.37] <ihatehex> never really had a valid reason to
[08:48.40] <koollman> but I think python is easier to start with, and I write more easily in it
[08:48.48] <ihatehex> perl is an interpreted language then?
[08:48.55] <stoopkid> ihatehex: yea
[08:49.02] <ihatehex> but it's dynamic
[08:49.04] <ihatehex> so it's evil
[08:49.13] <koollman> and perl can get ... rather obscure, to me. and to most of the world (some will mention it looks like linenoise)
[08:49.23] <ihatehex> show me some linenoise
[08:49.44] * Matthew_ (~Matthewrb@wikimedia/matthewrbowker) has joined channel ##programming
[08:49.49] <koollman> it's a common perl joke
[08:50.46] <vdamewood> One thing that Perl does that I haven't seen another language do is integrate regular expressions and pattern matching into the language syntax. Everything else seems to make some sort of class in the existing object system.
[08:50.51] * sctskw (~sctskw@c-50-152-30-192.hsd1.co.comcast.net) has joined channel ##programming
[08:50.56] <koollman> it's not really true. you can write obfuscated code in many languages. perl just really helps you ;)
[08:51.14] * chaintheory (~kaita9999@123.21.117.255) Quit (Ping timeout: 255 seconds)
[08:51.15] <ihatehex> I alternate between using three, six, and twelve spaces for indentations
[08:51.19] <ihatehex> depending on time of day
[08:51.22] <ihatehex> this is good practice yes?
[08:51.23] <ihatehex> :D
[08:51.37] <vdamewood> ihatehex: If not for the 12, I'd say you were the Sudoku indenter
[08:51.49] <koollman> vdamewood: the scalar/list context difference is uncommon enough, too
[08:52.03] <ihatehex> koollman, I'm looking at a weird perl example which says you can send emails with it
[08:52.09] <ihatehex> Wouldn't you need to set up passwords etc to send emails?
[08:52.09] <ihatehex> s:
[08:52.21] <ihatehex> ＋＋http://learn.perl.org/examples/email.html，， <- how would this work, doesn't seem to make sense
[08:52.23] * _X_C_V_B_ (~XCVB@dur-dhcp-1-117.dsl.airstreamcomm.net) Quit (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
[08:53.20] <vdamewood> It makes perfect sense to me.
[08:53.25] <_slade_> And the wonderful thing about modules is you don't need to know how they work.
[08:53.29] <koollman> ihatehex: you do not need passwords to send emails. most unix systems (and linux) have a mail transfer agent
[08:53.41] <vdamewood> You just have to have a configured and running MTA.
[08:53.47] <ihatehex> I don't even know what a mail transfer agent is
[08:53.47] <ihatehex> :(
[08:54.18] <koollman> so you probably need to know much more about what 'sending email' means
[08:54.47] <vdamewood> I wonder if I can send email between my Linux and OpenBSD systems.
[08:55.07] <vdamewood> Oh, nope. I don't have MX records for them.
[08:55.10] <koollman> vdamewood: I really do not see why you wouldn't be able to do that
[08:55.19] <koollman> A records are sufficient
[08:55.33] <vdamewood> Hmm... I'll have to try it then.

[08:56.04] <ihatehex> :O
[08:56.07] <ihatehex> it's ok
[08:56.37] <vdamewood> Well, the real reason I can't, right now, is that the OpenBSD VM isn't running. :)
[08:56.52] * ebz (~ebz@136.173.151.77.rev.sfr.net) Quit (Remote host closed the connection)
[08:57.29] <koollman> vdamewood: you still can. smtp is nice like that :)
[08:57.40] <ihatehex> I'm still on average 150, god damn it
[08:57.44] <ihatehex> I blame their stupid 2 lines at a time
[08:57.47] <ihatehex> I could hit 160 if I could see 3
[08:57.51] <vdamewood> koollman: The sender will just queue it until the receiver comes up?

[09:01.38] <Rainb> hey
[09:01.40] <Rainb> so uhm
[09:01.49] <Rainb> how does rooting a phone actually work
[09:02.01] <Rainb> There are probably different ways of how it works
[09:02.21] <plzburger> cd /
[09:02.22] <Rainb> but does someone knows how some way of rooting has worked
[09:02.32] <Rainb> lol..
[09:02.37] <vdamewood> This is weird. I thought I converted this C function to a C++ function.
[09:02.37] <plzburger> indeed.
[09:02.47] * matp_ (~matp@mail.matp.at) has joined channel ##programming
[09:02.55] <plzburger> vdamewood: you've only incremented it by one.

[09:03.44] <plzburger> you already have it.
[09:03.50] <koollman> (root privilege)

[09:04.40] <Rainb> Whatever, how does getting root permissions work
[09:04.56] <plzburger> simple. you get to use the root user/superuser
[09:04.58] * profess (~profess__@unaffiliated/csddesk) Quit (Quit: Leaving)
[09:04.59] * profess_ is now known as profess
[09:05.07] <Rainb> How do you do that?
[09:05.24] <plzburger> simple. you get the password, and then you log in with root + password
[09:05.32] <_slade_> Rainb: depends on the device
[09:05.36] <Rainb> so, rooters, are just crackers?
[09:05.52] <Rainb> like they crack up the password?
[09:05.53] <plzburger> hackers.
[09:06.01] <plzburger> they try to find a way around the password
[09:06.05] <koollman> you may want to ignore plzburger answers on this question, the sarcasm is strong there :)

[09:36.45] <PlanckWalk> That's useful, but it ends up being "unplug everything"
[09:37.25] <koollman> (the chromebook part started as an experiment on 'would very cheap hardware still be useful'. the answer is yes, very useful)
[09:37.25] <RustyShackleford> anyway, maybe I should stop being lazy and install a working OS on my desktop

[09:38.18] <PlanckWalk> I tried a tablet once and absolutely hated it for the things I usually do.

[09:38.50] <PlanckWalk> koollman: I mostly travel between work and home.  I have desktops at both ends 9and different tasks and data anyway)
[09:38.55] <vdamewood> RustyShackleford: To answer your question that started this, I use a laptop, and I don't even have a desktop right now.
[09:39.14] <PlanckWalk> The last time I used a laptop was for travel to another state, which doesn't happen often for me.
[09:39.26] <vdamewood> If I could afford an extra computer, I might have a desktop, or at least a headless tower, though.
[09:39.41] <RustyShackleford> i want an intel NUC

[09:40.15] <RustyShackleford> i don't play video games anymore, no need for a discrete graphics car
[09:40.26] <PlanckWalk> Maybe if I had a 1 hour commute on a train I might have more use for a laptop
[09:40.36] <PlanckWalk> As it is, I walk less than 10 minutes
[09:40.38] <vdamewood> I hate it when I add an ad-hoc print/message/echo statement and forget to remove it before committing.

[09:41.27] <vdamewood> I used to pull my laptop out on the bus and play MineCraft.
[09:41.27] <PlanckWalk> There aren't any trains here anyway
[09:41.49] <RustyShackleford> for my laying in bed and riding the train computing needs, the smartphone works fine for me
[09:41.53] <koollman> RustyShackleford: that was the initial purpose of my chromebook experiment. Cheap hardware :)
[09:42.07] <PlanckWalk> Actually, a tablet would probably work for most of that.  I'd probably just use it to read.

[09:46.33] <pulse> but you do need to learn a few tricks
[09:46.33] <koollman> RustyShackleford: which is why you get a laptop :)
[09:46.37] <pulse> for example the double tap
[09:47.18] <RustyShackleford> pulse: leisurely web browsing. Like reading reddit while I'm sitting on the toilet :P
[09:47.29] <pulse> nah, it sucks for reddit because the page is so damn wide :D
[09:47.37] <pulse> but it's pretty good for most sites
[09:47.51] <koollman> (but there are apps for reddit)
[09:47.52] <pulse> a lot of the web is responsive nowadays anyway
[09:48.02] <PlanckWalk> Maybe I'm just accustomed to browsing in a way that sucks for tablets
[09:48.20] <pulse> i got a whole new perspective when i learned about the double tap
[09:48.27] <pulse> it may sound silly but it's useful as hell
[09:48.30] <RustyShackleford> opening 100's of tabs doesn't work so great on tablets/phones
[09:48.30] * tmager (~Thunderbi@wr-130-64-194-38.medford.tufts.edu) Quit (Ping timeout: 246 seconds)
[09:48.43] <pulse> basically if you have a normal desktop page, if you double tap on an article, it will zoom in on it

[09:49.26] <RustyShackleford> mobile web ads are quite awful though
[09:49.28] <koollman> CoJaBo: :)
[09:49.43] <pulse> mobile ads in general are awful

[09:50.38] * ACDCGAMER (znc@unaffiliated/acdcgamer) has joined channel ##programming
[09:51.01] <pulse> Voyage, paypal has an API you can use
[09:51.05] <pulse> not sure about cards
[09:51.32] <vdamewood> For cards, you use PCI. But you should just use PayPal if you're not specializing in this kind of thing.
[09:51.45] <ACDCGAMER> For someone with some MySQL and Postgres experience, how difficult is it to pick up T-SQL?
[09:51.50] <vdamewood> Note that PCI is a standard for HOW you do it, not a service you can use.
[09:52.14] <vdamewood> ACDCGAMER: Can you make stored procedures in either ofthem?
[09:52.16] <wagonboi> radix sort is the shit
[09:52.30] <PlanckWalk> There are hundreds of payment providers that handle paypal and cards

[09:52.51] <PlanckWalk> Most of them suck, admittedly
[09:53.15] <ACDCGAMER> vdamewood: in MySQL, yeah. My SQL is a little rusty in general as I haven't touched it much for a bout a year (aside from some postgres at work), but yes, I can
[09:53.25] <PlanckWalk> On the other hand, most of them handle all sorts of fiddly crap so you don't have to.
[09:53.31] <vdamewood> I'd just used PayPal, unless the site grosses more than 10 million dollars per yer.
[09:53.33] <vdamewood> err year
[09:53.46] <ACDCGAMER> Thankfully I have stuff written down from when I took the class and I know there's a lot of documentation out there I can read. I still have my textbook too
[09:54.16] <PlanckWalk> I've had too many bad experiences with PayPal to want to make it my primary payment handler.

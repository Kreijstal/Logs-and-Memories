[01:09.38] <nortti> hi
[01:14.24] <Mmango> History channel, this could be a more popular irc channel, don’t you think?
[01:15.42] <nortti> hmm, not sure how large portion of freenode's userbase is actually interested in history
[01:16.24] <Mmango> True, maybe we could get some people from reddit’s history subreddits. They’re super active over there.
[01:16.39] <nortti> /r/badhistory!

[01:19.54] <nortti> I prefer /r/askhistorians over /r/askhistory, myself
[01:24.22] <Mmango> Oh yeah that’s the one I meant
[01:24.45] <Mmango> Great moderation on that one

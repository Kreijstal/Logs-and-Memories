[05:16.39] <SpeedEvil> sorry - I'm not up to detailed questions - need more coffee
[05:16.59] <ehrenhaft> ok
[05:17.12] * micronesia_x (~acg@gateway/vpn/privateinternetaccess/acg) Quit (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[05:17.23] <ehrenhaft> can anyone help me with it
[05:17.23] <ehrenhaft> ?

[05:18.28] <atomicalloy> ehrenhaft: I can't read sht from the text
[05:18.37] * micronesia_q (~acg@gateway/vpn/privateinternetaccess/acg) has joined channel ##physics
[05:19.07] <ehrenhaft> atomicalow, im suppoed to work out the angular velocity at any time t
[05:19.33] <ehrenhaft> atomicalloy I tried doing it like this, the distance travelled at any time is equal to the integral of angular velocity multiplied by the radius of the ball
[05:19.44] * micronesia (~acg@gateway/vpn/privateinternetaccess/acg) Quit (Ping timeout: 264 seconds)
[05:20.02] <ehrenhaft> atomicalloy which should be equal to the integral of the integral of net force creating the torque (rotational motion) divided by mass (m)
[05:20.11] <ehrenhaft> atomic alloy then solve for integral of angular velocity
[05:20.22] <ehrenhaft> atomic alloy but im not sure how to find the net force creating the motion of the ball down the hill
[05:20.37] <ehrenhaft> atomic alloy is it just the frictional force? since that creates the torque that causes the ball to rotate
[05:21.07] <ehrenhaft> atomicalloy or do I consider Friction - mgsin( theta), the component of weight in the direction of the inclined plane

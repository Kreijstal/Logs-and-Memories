[04:27.39] <Twey> apoplexy_da_boss: Print it out, grab it firmly in both hands, and apply lateral force
[04:28.09] <apoplexy_da_boss> its a forum that costs $400/month
[04:28.11] <apoplexy_da_boss> huge forum
[04:28.21] <apoplexy_da_boss> trying to store the data after my month term expires so i can keep reading content
[04:28.26] <apoplexy_da_boss> is this possible?
[04:30.06] * admg (~admg@host86-147-105-161.range86-147.btcentralplus.com) has joined channel ##programming
[04:30.40] <adsc> Ixxie: okay, but you specificially said it's unproductive, so I guess you were wrong

[04:31.44] <rindolf> Hi all! Sup?
[04:31.44] <Ixxie> adsc: sure, you got a point there. But I use this ancient Asian pedagogic technique where you emphasize the opposite of what somewhat else is convinced in order to cancel it out, if you know what I mean
[04:31.50] <adsc> apoplexy_da_boss: there is a firefox plugin i used in the past to download websites, called scrapbook i think
[04:31.59] <adsc> yo rindolf, how are you?
[04:32.12] <rindolf> adsc: I'm fine - I did backups yesterday.
[04:32.24] <adsc> did you do a restore test?
[04:32.35] <rindolf> adsc: and I started working on my April Fools' Day Gag for this year.
[04:32.39] <rindolf> adsc: no, not yet.
[04:32.40] <adsc> backups are worthless if you haven't restored them at least 1 successfully
[04:32.54] <rindolf> adsc: I have restored them in the past.
[04:33.13] <rindolf> But I'd like to do it again.
[04:33.33] <apoplexy_da_boss> thank you adsc, that is all i needed to know

[04:40.58] <adsc> i don't think he's a moron, but he's probably wrong in this matter
[04:41.25] <adsc> the way I see it, you pay for updated content on this forum, not simple acces
[04:41.44] <adsc> you basically pay to be part of the community and get the latest information

[05:17.40] <apoplexy_da_boss> im going to be pursuing internet marketing. landing pages are integral. lets say i have a concept i dont want taken but my landing pages are obviously displaying on other peoples computers -- is there a way to hide the code?
[05:17.49] <apoplexy_da_boss> or typically can someone just rip whatever they want
[05:18.10] <apoplexy_da_boss> (i want to be able to rip other peoples stuff but not have people rip mine) ;)
[05:18.23] <aawe> apoplexy_da_boss: so you want to display the idea on a landing page, but you don't want them to see the idea in case they steal it?
[05:18.35] <adsc> apoplexy_da_boss: well, you control what you serve them, so...
[05:18.36] * Corey84 (~Corey84@unaffiliated/corey84) has joined channel ##programming
[05:18.38] <aawe> sounds like having a cake and eating it
[05:18.50] <adsc> apoplexy_da_boss: what you serve them is what they get and they can do whatever they want with it

[05:19.13] * Corey84 (~Corey84@unaffiliated/corey84) has joined channel ##programming
[05:19.35] <apoplexy_da_boss> of course, they have to see it for me to generate revenue
[05:19.47] <apoplexy_da_boss> but my question is -- they can always just take the sourcecode and alter it and use it right?
[05:20.01] <aawe> yes, and that is never a problem
[05:20.03] <adsc> the html?
[05:20.14] <adsc> what they can get is what you give them
[05:20.18] <apoplexy_da_boss> (im not a programmer btw)
[05:20.20] <adsc> nothing more
[05:20.53] <apoplexy_da_boss> ok lets say an ad shows up on your computer. you're in internet marketing and like DAMN, THATS A SWEET LANDER DUDE! can you rip that exact page?
[05:21.03] <apoplexy_da_boss> using the sourcecode available via browser, etc etc?
[05:21.14] <adsc> i don't even understand what you're saying
[05:21.21] <apoplexy_da_boss> prob my fault
[05:21.32] <adsc> rip which page?
[05:21.35] <apoplexy_da_boss> when an ad shows up in a popup on your laptop
[05:21.36] <aawe> apoplexy_da_boss: why would anyone rip a "landing page" for someone elses product?
[05:21.39] <adsc> the page the ad is displayed on?
[05:21.47] <apoplexy_da_boss> its a popup
[05:21.53] <adsc> a popup window?
[05:21.56] <apoplexy_da_boss> yes
[05:22.07] <adsc> yeah, you can get all the content that is shown in the window
[05:22.19] <adsc> make an exact 1 to 1 copy of that page
[05:22.26] <apoplexy_da_boss> and just alter it for their own product if they liked the template, etc? aawe thats my concern
[05:22.34] <adsc> yep
[05:22.39] <apoplexy_da_boss> if its a good converting ad, ppl could potentially steal the ad and compete against me
[05:22.41] <apoplexy_da_boss> thats the logic
[05:22.49] <apoplexy_da_boss> take my "secret sauce"
[05:22.54] * Merkss (~Merkss@dhcp-089-098-150-090.chello.nl) has joined channel ##programming
[05:22.56] <Jck_true_> apoplexy_da_boss: Obfuscation is a way to avoid that - But I really wouldn't be concerned about that
[05:23.08] <apoplexy_da_boss> obfuscation = ?
[05:23.14] <Jck_true_> You don't see people copying Yahoo/Google/Microsoft blantly anyway
[05:23.17] <pyon> apoplexy_da_boss: Once you deploy information to the user, what the user does with it is none of your business - even if it were, you can't control it.
[05:23.27] <apoplexy_da_boss> pyon: i understand
[05:23.34] <aawe> apoplexy_da_boss: and if they do this, how does it matter?
[05:23.43] <pyon> apoplexy_da_boss: Obfuscation is making code deliberately harder to understand.
[05:23.47] <aawe> how do you suffer if someone else use your shitty design?
[05:23.53] <pyon> hard*
[05:23.54] <apoplexy_da_boss> because they can setup a campaign for the same production, outbid me for clicks and take profits lol
[05:24.02] <apoplexy_da_boss> and then how am i supposed to pay the hydro bill, aawe ?
[05:24.12] <aawe> you own a hydroelectric plant?
[05:24.22] * d_k (~dk@cpc68034-cmbg14-2-0-cust100.5-4.cable.virginm.net) Quit (Quit: d_k)
[05:24.23] <apoplexy_da_boss> ah ok
[05:24.33] <aawe> your water bill?
[05:24.34] <apoplexy_da_boss> ok perfect, thanks for the help guys :]
[05:24.42] <adsc> you know that designs can be copyrighted
[05:24.53] <adsc> if someone copies your design, you can sue them

[05:25.22] * Gluesticky (~IceChat9@unaffiliated/gluesticky) has joined channel ##programming
[05:25.38] <adsc> obfuscation is not really effective, btw.
[05:25.52] <Jck_true_> I love how ##programming is always about solving problems that shouldn't even be problems in the first place :D
[05:25.54] <adsc> there are a lot of simplifiers out there that remove obfuscation
[05:26.16] <aawe> copying a design only requires a set of eyes and a graphics editor
[05:26.38] * varibull_ (~varibull@c-69-137-131-106.hsd1.de.comcast.net) Quit (Remote host closed the connection)
[05:26.40] <Jck_true_> Yeah it does seem rather pointless to obfuscate HTML
[05:27.02] * varibull_ (~varibull@c-69-137-131-106.hsd1.de.comcast.net) has joined channel ##programming
[05:27.11] <Jck_true_> (One could argue it's already happying with thoose stupid Javascript and CSS compressors...)
[05:27.15] * eniLCP_ (~eniLCP__@cpe-69-133-54-2.cinci.res.rr.com) Quit (Ping timeout: 246 seconds)
[05:27.16] <Jck_true_> happening*
[05:27.48] * pyon wonders why not make browsers simply deploy binaries.
[05:28.13] <pyon> Minified JavaScript isn't readable -- yet it still takes more space than equivalent bytecode would.
[05:28.23] <pyon> Actually, most JavaScript isn't readable even before minifying.
[05:28.27] <Jck_true_> Too much legacy..
[05:28.58] <Jck_true_> pyon: Wanna bring back Gopher?
[05:29.12] <pyon> Jck_true_: I wasnt' complaining about HTTP.
[05:29.15] <pyon> (Today.)
[05:29.49] <adsc> well, you should, do
[05:29.54] <adsc> because it's terrible
[05:30.15] * lapide_viridi (~lapide_vi@ip-245-51-149-91.dialup.ice.net) has joined channel ##programming
[05:30.21] <pyon> adsc: Oh, I've expressed my dissatisfaction with HTML at some point in time.
[05:30.32] <pyon> adsc: It's just that I don't see how Gopher is an alternative to *JavaScript*.
[05:30.50] <pyon> Jck_true_: A much better retord would've been "Wanna bring back Java applets?"
[05:30.57] <pyon> retort*
[05:31.10] <Jck_true_> Well you wanted bytecode :)
[05:31.32] <pyon> And what does Gopher have to do with bytecode?
[05:31.32] <Jck_true_> You can also have flash (But not shockwave)

[05:32.07] <Jck_true_> pyon: You're right - You're right
[05:33.30] <pyon> Anyway, the Web is the way it is, because it's built atop one layer after another of permissive technologies.
[05:33.37] * apotheon (~ren@copyfree/founder/apotheon) Quit (Ping timeout: 246 seconds)
[05:34.12] <adsc> indeed
[05:34.21] <pyon> Crap code that isn't even properly thought out gets posted for the whole world to see, because "it seems to work".
[05:34.39] <adsc> and is then used to build even crappier code
[05:35.03] <adsc> at some point, features emerge from all the holes in the code that nobody thought would be possible

[06:00.09] <nikio_> you guys know the advantage of using  a heap structure for a priority que in terms of time complexity
[06:00.10] <nikio_> ?

[06:04.35] <pyon> nikio_: Um, there's more than one heap structure.
[06:05.16] <pyon> nikio_: "Heap" and "priority queue" are pretty much synonymous: they don't refer to a specific implementation, they refer to the signature of an abstract type.
[06:05.43] <nikio_> nope pyo
[06:05.43] <nikio_> n
[06:05.50] <nikio_> pyon a heap is a binary tree structure
[06:06.07] <pyon> nikio_: Are you talking about *binary* heaps?
[06:06.24] <pyon> nikio_: I'm pretty sure there are multiple possible heap structures, and I can provide examples.
[06:06.57] <nikio_> pyon more generally a heap is a tree
[06:07.13] <nikio_> so its not as abstract as a priority quee
[06:07.20] <nikio_> which can be implemented using a heap
[06:07.42] <pyon> nikio_: Binomial heaps (and variants: scheduled binomial heaps, skew-binomial heaps, etc.), Fibonacci heaps, leftist heaps, bootstrapped heaps (parameterized by an underlying primitive heap type)...
[06:07.51] <pyon> ＋＋https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_heap，，

[06:08.19] <pyon> ＋＋https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leftist_tree，，
[06:08.38] <pyon> nikio_: Binary heaps are just one particular implementation of heaps.
[06:08.47] <pyon> (And not even a particularly good one.)
[06:08.55] <nikio_> pyon they are all tree based
[06:09.10] <pyon> nikio_: A binomial heap is actually a forest - a collection of trees.

[06:09.30] <nikio_> pyon ok, but still its more abstract than a priority que

[06:10.28] <halcyforn> hello. i need small help, i must wirite a smal program what calculate something and make result to pdf, this must be multiplatform(mac linux and windows) what language shuld be good for this and easy.
[06:11.00] <nikio_> pyon a priority quee isnt aka a heap because it can be implemented using other types of data structures than a heap

[06:11.28] <rindolf> pyon: hi, what time is it there?
[06:11.29] <nikio_> pyon While priority queues are often implemented with heaps, they are conceptually distinct from heaps. A priority queue is an abstract concept like "a list" or "a map"; just as a list can be implemented with a linked list or an array, a priority queue can be implemented with a heap or a variety of other methods such as an unordered array.

[06:16.15] <pyon> nikio_: Quoting Purely Functional Data Structures: "Heaps are *often* implemented as heap-ordered trees, in which the element at each node is no larger than the elements at its children. Under this ordering, the minimum element in a tree is always at the root." [Emphasis mine.] Heaps don't need to be implemented using heap-ordered trees. They just *often* are.
[06:16.58] * VaticanCameos (~pritishc@182.68.132.77) Quit (Ping timeout: 246 seconds)
[06:17.19] <pyon> nikio_: You're just conflating a heap with a heap-ordered tree.
[06:18.15] <nikio_> pyon that book sounds a bit shitty
[06:18.17] <nikio_> In computer science, a heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property: If A is a parent node of B then the key of node A is ordered with respect to the key of node B with the same ordering applying across the heap. Heaps can be classified further as either a "max heap" or a "min heap". In a max heap, the keys of parent nodes are always greater than or equal to those of the children and the highest k
[06:18.18] <nikio_> ey is in the root node. In a min heap, the keys of parent nodes are less than or equal to those of the children and the lowest key is in the root node.
[06:18.32] <nikio_> this is less vague  than the quote from your book

[06:20.38] <pyon> nikio_: Also, anyone who knows order theory knows that the distinction between min-heap and max-heap is superfluous: the inverse of a weak total order is also a weak total order. A so-called "max-heap" is just a regular min-heap (there is no other kind) whose underlying order is the inverse of another order you're considering.

[08:11.17] <ihatehex> I mean roaches is obvious, you fry 'em and then you slice them into pieces and make them into flour
[08:11.20] <nitrxgen_> a couple of coworkers were having a discussion about me and i walked in, they didnt know if i liked them as friends or not because i talk to them weird
[08:11.23] <ihatehex> you can't flour-ize a rat

[08:54.33] <DogPolice> Either A: The instructor didn't teach it in the way you liked, or B: You were either distracted or didn't care.
[08:54.46] <DogPolice> abugar: Nope. Python is not a compiled language. You can use it.
[08:55.03] <abugar> Not a compiled language? What does that mean?
[08:55.06] <Rainb> and people who like math, can work on it.
[08:55.39] <DogPolice> abugar: It means that it's not a compiled language. It doesn't compile to a binary. This is a pretty loose term.
[08:56.16] <abugar> Okay, I think I understand. But how is the source code made into an executeable?
[08:56.25] <DogPolice> abugar: It isn't.
[08:56.25] <abugar> Or how does it run?
[08:56.29] <Rainb> it is interpreted

[09:02.07] <Rainb> and without intuition you're no better than computers, and computers are faster and more accurate than you.
[09:02.08] <DogPolice> Your problem is its conveyance.
[09:02.18] <Rainb> so, you're just as useless.

First, people could specialize more on what they're good, and if they're good at math, fantastic, let them be. But if you're good at art, you just shouldn't be forced to memorize formulas, be evaluated for them. Maybe if you change how math is tested will change how math is taught.

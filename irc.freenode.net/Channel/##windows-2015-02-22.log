[01:44.30] <kuahara> Allow remote connections to this computer is already selected on the windows 8 host machine
[01:44.38] <kuahara> and both machines are in the same workgroup and on the same network
[01:45.16] <kuahara> client can't find the host.  tried connecting using the statically assigned IP the host machine has.  also tried using the machine name
[01:45.16] <kuahara> neither work
[01:45.49] <sepeck> make sure the RDP client onthe WIndows 7 machine is the latest available
[01:46.19] <sepeck> otherwise on the windows 8 machine sabotage the security by allowing connecitons from less secure clients

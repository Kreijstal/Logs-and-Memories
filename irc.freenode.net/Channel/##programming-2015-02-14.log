[12:01.55] <pyon> Today I feel like a hero. I <strike>essentually wrote myself</strike> helped write all of Wader8 's program. And there was no XML involved.

[12:02.18] <jeaye> essentually
[12:02.38] <jeaye> essentially + eventually
[12:02.44] <jrslepak> pyon: does that mean he'll leave us alone now? ¬_¬
[12:02.49] * day- (~day@unaffiliated/day) Quit (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[12:02.58] <pyon> jrslepak: dunno
[12:03.06] <Sadale> lel
[12:03.19] <Sadale> pyon, why XML? ;_;
[12:03.24] <jrslepak> pyon: or is this like dane-geld, where the next time he wants some little custom program, he's going to come here and whine until you write that for him too?
[12:03.40] <Sadale> jrslepak++
[12:03.41] <pyon> jrslepak: Let's hope not
[12:04.00] <Sadale> "Write your damn code"
[12:04.13] <Sadale> It's the way to learn programming
[12:04.21] <pyon> But, anyway, I hope my contribution to this channel's peace is appreciated.
[12:04.36] * Krixvar (~quassel@cpe-69-207-88-145.rochester.res.rr.com) has joined channel ##programming
[12:05.09] <Sadale> pyon, if you haven't answer him, he will not come here to ask again. After getting helped, he may ask here later :p
[12:05.14] * Sadale singing trololo
[12:05.18] <Myrl> "102 x 64 screen"
[12:05.18] * Rilakkuma (~textual@122.29.165.22) Quit (Quit: My Mac has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[12:05.24] <Sadale> Myrl, wat?
[12:05.35] <Myrl> Sadale: EA DOGS102W-6
[12:05.36] <Sadale> Myrl, is that an LCD for embedded programming?
[12:05.39] <pyon> Sadale: I essentially wrote the program myself. I wrote an Excel VBA macro without having Windows (let alone Excel) installed on my computer.
[12:05.50] <Myrl> Why is it 102!?
[12:05.52] <Sadale> pyon, ah
[12:05.53] <pyon> The ability to program using paper and pencil came in handy.
[12:05.54] <Myrl> o.e
[12:06.14] <Sadale> Myrl, because lulz
[12:06.19] <jeaye> That's how I write all my C++
[12:06.24] --QuantumP7-- logged in with account (QuantumP7)
[12:06.33] <Sadale> interesting. 102 = 51x2. hmm. but why?
[12:06.43] <jrslepak> pyon: yes, it was a good way to pass the time in class while lecture was going very slowly over material I'd seen multiple times in undergrad ¬_¬
[12:06.44] <pyon> jeaye: Ok, that outbadass'd me.
[12:06.51] <Sadale> 51 is a prime number if  remember correctly
[12:06.55] <Myrl> No.
[12:07.00] <Myrl> It can be divided by 3.
[12:07.03] <Sadale> never mind
[12:07.04] <Myrl> 17 x 6.
[12:07.10] <pyon> Writing C++ using paper and pencil only, no debugging tools at all... that's super badass.
[12:07.12] <Sadale> ok.
[12:07.16] <jeaye> I only started using a text editor because uploading images of the paper to github is slower.
[12:07.22] <Sadale> Myrl, Probably 6 is the width of each charcter :p
[12:07.23] <pyon> lol
[12:07.23] <pyon>

[12:08.57] <Myrl> I program with the description of an API in my browser, so I can't really program on pen and paper. :(
[12:09.07] <Myrl> How much more if I was using PHP.
[12:09.20] <pyon> Oh, did I mention I had to manually convert between Excel column labels (A,B,C...) and numbers (A -> 1, B -> 2, C -> 3...)?
[12:09.20] <pyon>  
[12:09.37] <pyon> Problem is columns went as far as KZ or something like that.

[12:40.18] <yoda> curious rsync came out in 1996 around so did they have any mirroring or backup based software before rsync i get they had for code/software repo like cvs and even older repo software but for mirroring or backing up whole servers was it just ftp ,telnet , like dd or something
[12:42.09] <yoda> what was the common backup method for begining of computers up to the mid 90's when rsync and tons of backup software started to come out as well as tons of cloning software

[02:01.43] <grill> the way i understood it, equivalence classes (in this case) are all the strings that are in the language, and all the strings that are not in the language
[02:01.45] <arathald> so are the strings "0" and "1" equivalent?
[02:02.01] <grill> yes
[02:02.19] <arathald> actually they're not

[02:04.27] <nisstyre> sorry I was talking about grill not you
[02:04.30] <grill> yes, and 0 and 1 are both accepted by this language
[02:04.31] <grill> so they're equal
[02:04.31] <arathald> so my answer was right the first time for the equivalent *class*
[02:04.50] <arathald> *equivalance
[02:05.06] <nisstyre> grill: so the relation is "a is accepted and b is accepted" ?
[02:05.08] <arathald> the equivalence classes, like I said before are {11, 111} and the set of all strings except {11, 111}
[02:05.42] <grill> ok. let's rewind this a bit
[02:05.42] <grill> what's an equivalence relation

[02:10.56] <grill> those general statements don't do anything for me
[02:11.06] <grill> so let's work through some examples
[02:11.07] <nisstyre> ＋＋https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_relation#Simple_example，，
[02:11.12] <grill> for example, what makes the = relation on the numbers {1, 2, 3} an equivalence relation?
[02:11.40] <grill> ok
[02:11.52] <grill> so this is where math people differ from regular people
[02:12.01] <grill> in fact, i believe i could make an equivvalence relation out of it
[02:12.05] <nisstyre> because that relation (equality on integers I guess?) holds the properties needed
[02:12.50] <grill> "people who think the definition of equivalence relation is trivally obvious" on the set of all people
[02:12.54] * rcris01 (~rcris01@50.127.45.173) has joined channel ##programming
[02:13.41] <grill> coincidentally, this equivalence relation is congruent to "math people" on the set of all people
[02:13.46] <arathald> no one said it was obvious. in fact, the point is that it's not
[02:14.03] <arathald> nor is it trivially simple
[02:14.22] <arathald> there's a lot of background to truly understand these things
[02:14.33] <pyon> grill: Think of a set as a cake. An equivalence relation is like slicing a cake.

[02:20.21] <pyon> An equivalence relation is (1) reflexive [xRx], (2) symmetric [xRy = yRx], (3) transitive [(xRy /\ yRz) -> xRz].
[02:20.43] <arathald> grill: then you might need more background :/

[02:21.28] <arathald> the article isn't overly cimplicated, but it assumes some level of math knowledge

[02:22.14] <grill> i can listen to pyon all day, and what he says makes sense. i can read wikipedia all day, and all i get is annoted
[02:22.21] <grill> *annoyed
[02:22.31] <grill> ok
[02:22.49] <Rainb> math in wikipedia is very formalized
[02:23.01] <Rainb> not good for learning or understanding, great for reviewing tho
[02:23.02] <grill> so how does the equivalence relation work for {w | w is any string except 11 and 111}
[02:23.18] <pyon> Rainb: The point to formalizing is to provide a better alternative to understanding.

[02:23.46] * pyon isn't really always that clear.
[02:24.08] <Rainb> Except everything is too abstract and you just don't really understand what it's talking about maybe is the terms they use
[02:24.12] <grill> how exactly are the strings symmetric
[02:24.19] <pyon> Rainb: That's the point: forget about understanding, just calculate.
[02:24.25] <Rainb> maybe simple english wikipedia will be more helpful someday
[02:24.26] <grill> i know 1 and 0 are in the language
[02:24.32] <Rainb> Except I want to understand
[02:24.38] <Snake2k> pyon > life
[02:24.39] <Rainb> I can't calculate if I don't understnad
[02:24.44] <Snake2k> Well...
[02:24.47] <Snake2k> pyon >= life
[02:24.47] <grill> i'm the same way
[02:24.50] <arathald> Rainb: it's hard to get rid of those terms, because they mean extremel specific things
[02:24.50] <Rainb> It is a mechanical job to do it
[02:24.57] <grill> it's bullshit, but that's the way i am
[02:25.00] <grill> anyway
[02:25.05] <Rainb> a computer doesn't need to understand, to calculate
[02:25.07] <grill> so 0 and 1 are two strings in the language

[02:26.26] <Rainb> if I don't understand I don't see the point, if I don't see the point, I really stress myself, out of curiousity, or something

[02:43.16] <ykzrtj> Hi all, I’m learning databases. What is the difference between a constraint and a domain of an attribute? Is a constraint a further restriction on the domain? Or is the constraint an implementation of the domain?
[02:43.23] <grill> ok
[02:43.24] <Myrl> I only had 100 MB RAM left, and Windows didn't alert me.
[02:43.29] <grill> tha's fine
[02:44.14] <amigojapan> pyon: I think it can be achieved with just game sprites …..  like circles… I have a program that does some of the thinsg I mentioned….. I think of hte the problems is “not enough time to evolve”   but I really thinkit is mostly that people have not put in enough effort in this task
[02:44.48] <arathald> amigojapan: something very much like it is widely used, genetic/evolutionary algorithms
[02:45.04] <amigojapan> arathald: do you have a youtube video to it?
[02:45.21] <arathald> amigojapan: no, look it up. its very common
[02:45.22] <pyon> ykzrtj: The domain of an attribute is the type of its possible values. A constraint if an additional restriction that the values of attributes must satisfy.
[02:45.35] <amigojapan> arathald: oh, you mean just any genetic algo…. ok
[02:45.36] <arathald> youll find all kinds of things on it

[02:52.07] <amigojapan> ah ok vdamewood
[02:52.10] <pyon> ykzrtj: Don't worry. For practical purposes, "domain" here just means "type".
[02:52.13] <vdamewood> amigojapan: Before, I *thought* it might be VMware, but now Im certain.
[02:52.13] <ykzrtj> In terms of set theory and basic mathematics of functions, I can relate to how relational databases are formed. But I don’t think I can understand the higher mathematics that represents it.
[02:52.22] <pyon> ykzrtj: And "constraint" means "an additional restriction that doesn't directly follow from the type"

[02:58.09] <amigojapan> I see vdamewood
[02:58.12] <arathald> thecha: grill: a zero-day attack is one that hadn't been publicly announced or patched yet. In other words, it can be exploited *before* day 1, on "day zero"
[02:58.13] <pyon> grill: "If there are n states, then partition the set of all finite strings into n subsets, where subset S_i is the set of strings that, when given as input to automaton A, cause it to end in state i."

[02:59.48] <vdamewood> amigojapan Why it would not... use the network?

[02:59.59] <grill> pyon can you explain that using more words>?
[03:00.07] <arathald> thecha: it's likely, yes. what makes it a zero day is who finds it first
[03:00.09] * Filystyn (~piotr@031011212161.warszawa.vectranet.pl) has joined channel ##programming
[03:00.28] <arathald> if security reasearchers or maintainers find it first, it generally doesn't become a zero-day
[03:00.50] <arathald> if people who can exploit it or sell the information find it first, it often becomes a zero-day
[03:01.02] <thecha> @arathwald so they are not known as long as they exist, but known after being remedied, thus younevr know if any thing has a zero day bug so you should act as if all of them had?
[03:01.05] <grill> pyon actually
[03:01.18] <thecha> is there software where you know there are no zero day bugs?
[03:01.31] <thecha> does js have any zero day bugs yet?
[03:01.33] <vdamewood> amigojapan: Oh, Why it would not support Solaris (re Virtual Box). That was Tongue in cheek. They are both from Oracle, and were from Sun before. Virtual Box supports Solaris like Linux supports Bash.

[03:02.03] <arathald> thecha: hello world, maybe, though that also relies on the security of the underlying framework, so, basically, no, there's no absolute way to say something isn't vulnerable to zero day bugd
[03:02.10] <pyon> grill: If a finite state automaton is deterministic, then, if you feed a fixed string to the automaton, the automaton will reach a uniquely determined state.
[03:02.16] <arathald> the only way is if the thing has zero need for security

[03:03.05] <amigojapan> ah   true hehehe vdamewood
[03:03.11] <pyon> grill: If two strings make the automaton reach the same state, they belong in the same equivalence class.
[03:03.33] <arathald> thecha: and yes, whenever you're working on something in which security is or should be any kind of cinsideration at all, you should always assume there are security bugs that you haven't found, and that attackers may find first
[03:03.38] <pyon> grill: And it is clear that two strings in the same equivalence class have no distinguishing extension.
[03:03.39] <grill> pyon reach or end in?

[03:03.56] <thecha> arathald or already hav found?

[03:06.14] <amigojapan> ah ok vdamewood

[03:16.02] <grill> sorry for all the questions. i just can't read+understand wikipedia right now
[03:16.02] <vdamewood> I wonder if I have any incidences of support with VMware.
[03:16.30] <grill> pyon one and only one?
[03:17.14] <pyon> grill: It is more or less clear that, if the minimal DFA has "n" states, there are at most "n" equivalence classes. What the theorem itself guarantees is that there are exactly "n" equivalence classes.
[03:17.32] <pyon> grill: One and only one what?

[03:17.48] <BlastHardcheese> And the speculated vulnerability was in an encryption algorithim, which is math, and hardcore math at that. Anyway there is almost no reason for anyone to go to all the effort of deliberately introducting a backdoor into most systems because most software is so crappy and full of bugs as it is. About the only reason it would be done would be for a targeted attack on a hardened target. Otherwise your resources are ...
[03:17.55] <BlastHardcheese> ... much better spent just finding bugs in existing code or buying zero-days on the market.
[03:18.01] <grill> pyon sec. i will show you an example

[03:19.20] <arathald> BlastHardcheese: the problem wasn't actually with the mathematical algorithms itself (which was certainly understood by others), but with the selection of the constants (which is much more subtle)

[03:20.26] <ash__> do I need to draw a window in qt to change the icon on the window with a scroll up or down and a executable link? For example can I draw one window that can scroll through all the programs installed, or does each window have to drawn to link the executable and it's accompanying icon, description etc

[03:21.16] <BlastHardcheese> yes, also a number of people suspected the algorithim was flawed for years; the only reason it got used as widely as it did was because the NSA allegedly bribed RSA to set it as the default in one of their products

[03:25.30] <arathald> thecha: (1) no, (2) js is reviewed by a lot of people in different places. plus js is a specification, each implementation would be vulnerable to its own issues as well as issues with the specification

[03:26.06] <arathald> though it's generally maintained by a consortium of browser and other industry developers
[03:26.12] <SparkyFlary> I thought mozilla and google were completely in charge
[03:26.22] <arathald> microsoft also plays a huge part
[03:26.32] <arathald> and apple
[03:26.39] <SparkyFlary> with mozilla being developer of it
[03:26.50] <arathald> basically, any browser manufacturer, plus a lot of other people
[03:26.58] <arathald> SparkyFlary: no, each develops its own implementation
[03:27.01] <arathald> js is a specification
[03:27.17] <Snake2k> JavaScript is what Santa gave to Mozilla for being bad.
[03:27.32] <arathald> ie, firefox, chrome, and safari each has its own independent javascript engine
[03:27.35] <Sadale> Snake2k, did you mean satan/
[03:27.36] <Sadale> ?
[03:27.54] <Snake2k> Sadale: Santa == Satan... Satan prefers C though...
[03:27.55] <vdamewood> JavaScript is older than Mozilla.
[03:27.59] <Snake2k> Sadale: C for everything >_>
[03:28.22] <grill> I'm pretty sure that's the minimal DFA for the language

[03:29.19] <arathald> thecha: free software is a dual-edged sword. you get more eyes on it from independent places, but those eyes may or may not be experts. look at what happened with openssh
[03:29.38] <vdamewood> Snake2k: I'm not sure what you're asking, but I think the answer is Netscape.
[03:29.39] <thecha> thecha heard about that
[03:29.46] <arathald> thecha: the companies that weren't vulnerable to heartbleed were the ones with custom ssh stacks, proprietary ones
[03:29.58] <Snake2k> vdamewood: Where it first started, Yep Netscape >_>
[03:30.02] <arathald> which isn't to say proprietary is better either
[03:30.15] <thecha> it is to say int his case cusotm/obscure is better
[03:30.17] <arathald> just that it's silly to make such blanket statements about free vs proprietary

[03:30.51] <Snake2k> arathald++
[03:30.53] <arathald> you need good developers who know security
[03:31.03] <arathald> whether they are paid or from the community
[03:31.18] <arathald> the skill of the developers is what matters, not where they come from
[03:31.31] <vdamewood> Even developers from the ghetto can be good.
[03:31.36] <Snake2k> arathald: Motivating great security researchers from the community takes alot of work vs paying someone a good amount (if you can afford it)
[03:31.39] <SparkyFlary> what if the developers are in it only for the money?
[03:31.47] <Snake2k> ^+1
[03:31.48] <thecha> so that means we the people need to become better /good at programing in order to mainaint software freedom?
[03:32.01] <arathald> Snake2k: yeah, security especially, it's important to have people who really know what they're doing

[03:32.47] <Myrl> what did I just step into? :D
[03:32.47] <Snake2k> SparkyFlary: Usually are, very few security researchers would just patch a bug for something for free... Not saying that they don't... They do, but every human wants something in return. Most want more than a Thank you by a person who made a software which doesn't have much revenue.
[03:33.03] <Snake2k> arathald: True true
[03:33.14] <SparkyFlary> is it better to have people who know what they're doing or people who actually care?
[03:33.22] <Snake2k> thecha: Motivation is what's needed to keep Free "OR" Open Source alive
[03:33.23] <grill> pyon ?
[03:33.28] <Stryyker> care doesn't make it good
[03:33.37] <Snake2k> SparkyFlary: People who actually care >= People who know what they're doing
[03:33.38] <arathald> well, it's not necessarily a matter of not wanting to do it for free, but a lot of full-time programmers, especially experienced ones, don't necessarily want to go home and code in the evening

[03:34.14] <Snake2k> Myrl: A weird borderline FOSS vs Proprietary "discussion" (pretty safe so far lol)
[03:34.19] <thecha> peopel who work as a dev in their 9 to 5 still can contribute to free software and many do
[03:34.23] <thecha> it isnt either or
[03:34.24] <Snake2k> Myrl: No chairs have been thrown, yet.
[03:34.37] <arathald> a huge amount of FOSS contribution is from people working on those projects as part of their day jobs (company needs a feature, contributes the code back to the community)
[03:34.46] <Stryyker> we're too lazy to get off the chairs
[03:34.56] <Snake2k> arathald: Like Linux
[03:35.00] <arathald> precisely
[03:35.16] <thecha> snake2k what you mean linux?
[03:35.31] <Myrl> ic.
[03:35.33] <thecha> linux was paid for by ibm or something?
[03:35.35] <arathald> thecha: most contributions to linux aren't from hobbyists, but from companies
[03:35.36] <Snake2k> thecha: Most contributions to Linux are paid by some entity i.e; Red Hat
[03:35.50] <Snake2k> Devs are hired, "I said most"
[03:36.08] <Snake2k> If Linux was solely free devs like us, it'd be as big as Gentoo

Why let us do that with a simple command?
[07:24.00] <neagle3> It's never explained in any guides or in any official documentation.

[07:54.34] <Myrl> not that. lol.
[07:54.41] <Henke37> impossible

[07:55.14] <CoJaBo> robots.txt will do that, yes..?

[07:55.17] <wei2912> nope

[07:55.21] <wei2912> a triangle can make up any polygon
[07:55.26] <Henke37> robots.txt is voulentarily
[07:55.40] <CoJaBo> You can't do much better than it.
[07:55.50] <Henke37> sure you can, you can address the real problem
[07:55.51] <wei2912> ^^
[07:55.51] <Myrl> Also. You can't really make a circle with points.
[07:55.53] * hgf (~hgf@177.142.96.80) has joined channel ##programming

[07:56.14] <Henke37> Myrl, sure you can, if you accept just one point as the solution
[07:56.16] <Myrl> I know.
[07:56.22] <Henke37> a circle can be defined as a point and a radius
[07:56.30] <Myrl> True.
[07:56.54] <wei2912> why are you asking anyways?
[07:56.54] <CoJaBo> boodllebat: URLs are pretty public. Someone could trivially write a crawler to enumerate them all, for example; if your app relies on URL secrecy, you need to rethink it.
[07:56.55] <Henke37> boodllebat, protect from which action?
[07:57.08] <aidanh> Well, every shape is a set of points; therefore you can make any shape out of points
[07:57.17] <wei2912> ^^
[07:57.24] <Henke37> aidanh, there is more to it
[07:57.28] <Myrl> Meh.
[07:57.37] <Serpentine_> You can also put an uncountably infinite number of infinitesimal points in areas that satisfy the equation x^2+y^2=r^2
[07:57.41] <Myrl> wei2912: I have something tto search.
[07:57.48] <Henke37> you need to know how the shape is defined
[07:57.57] <wei2912> Myrl: you could always throw in a horrible pun

[07:59.00] <Myrl> I already said an example is a triangle.
[07:59.00] <Henke37> for example, a beizer curve is quite different than a plain old polygon, yet both are defined with points

[08:01.05] <Myrl> Hey guys. General graphics programming question. There's a term for shapes that can form any other shape. An example of that is a triangle(and hence why some graphics language just only allows triangles). What's the term for this?
[08:01.29] <xuesheng1> primitive
[08:01.43] <aidanh> Oh yeah, of course
[08:01.45] <Henke37> most people consider cubes primitives
[08:01.51] <Henke37> yet those are composed out of triangles
[08:01.58] <Myrl> Not really a primitive.

[12:30.39] <Ouroboros_> s3a: ＋＋http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_variable#Functions_of_random_variables，，
[12:30.59] <s3a> Ouroboros_, are you implying that i'm saying nonsense? :P

[12:31.24] <s3a> Ouroboros_, (but thanks for that link)
[12:31.32] <s3a> i saw the link, but didn't notice that section
[12:31.59] <Dann20> Anyone?
[12:32.23] <s3a> Ouroboros_, but, could you just give me one simple-to-understand sentence that doesn't go too deep about functions of random variables like Y = X^2 + 1?
[12:33.22] <Rainb> how do I calculate "bulgeness" of a curve as in, very round or very square-like
[12:33.32] <Rainb> if that makes any sense
[12:33.39] * goodenough (~goodenoug@pool-108-13-13-188.lsanca.fios.verizon.net) has joined channel ##math
[12:33.40] <Ouroboros_> s3a: i guess essentially P(Y = y) = sum_{x | x^2+1 = y} P(x), but there might be some technicalities why you want to use the CDF instead
[12:33.54] <lavender> rainb: do you mean curvature?

[12:34.52] <paulo___> hello, simple statistics question, I have a game with a chance of winning P, I have n tries. what is the probability that I win once?
[12:34.57] <paulo___> *once or more
[12:34.58] * mooson (~mooson@24-240-26-230.dhcp.gwnt.ga.charter.com) Quit (Quit: Leaving)
[12:35.07] <paulo___> I just need to win once.
[12:35.16] <Ouroboros_> paulo___: what is the probability that you always lose?
[12:35.26] <Rainb> lavender: Maybe, I think so.
[12:35.34] <lavender> well, curvature has a definition
[12:35.46] <lavender> you can ask the wikipedia for detials
[12:36.01] <s3a> Ouroboros_, what you wrote seems like it could be simpler than the other stuff that i read, but i realize i'm just too sleepy to think anymore . . . I'll look at my logs tomorrow. thanks. :)
[12:36.03] <paulo___> Intuition tells me that the more chances n I get, the higher the probability of winning
[12:36.25] <Rainb> lavender: I looked curvature in wikipedia up, before replying as I didn't know what curvature was.
[12:36.27] <lavender> can you quantify that intuition?
[12:37.12] <euclid> I should have that: (1+j/n)^((1/2)*(n+j+1) * (1-j/n)^((1/2)*(n-j+1) approximately equals exp(-j^2/2n)
[12:37.15] <paulo___> for P=50%, the chance of winning is 1-2^-n
[12:37.19] <Rainb> lavender: so a small curvature means that the curve is very square like, however a 'infinite' curvature would be a line
[12:37.21] * frivol (~frivol@unaffiliated/flippo) Quit (Quit: Reality reasserts itself sooner or later.)
[12:37.36] <euclid> for the big expression on left, you take the ln and then use taylor series and stop at second term because j/n is very small
[12:37.39] <euclid> then raise to e
[12:37.48] * lnk (~lnk@mail.cerronavia.cl) Quit (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[12:37.50] <euclid> but i keep getting exp(-j^2(n-1)/2n^2
[12:37.52] <euclid> )

[12:38.06] * illustion (~Mr@static24-89-78-232.r.rev.accesscomm.ca) Quit (Quit: illustion)
[12:38.17] <paulo___> how do I solve it for arbitrary P?

[12:40.22] <Ouroboros_> ok, what is the proability of losing the first time AND the second time?
[12:40.34] <paulo___> (1-P)(1-P) ?

[12:00.01] <Dann20> then -x
[12:00.02] <Dann20> ?
[12:00.09] * shij020l (~sjowpp0@24-212-200-121.cable.teksavvy.com) Quit (Remote host closed the connection)
[12:00.36] * vonStrauss (~vonStraus@unaffiliated/vonstrauss) has joined channel ##math
[12:00.56] <spudzee1111> and is e euler’s number/constant whatever?
[12:00.57] * Neutron (~neutron@17.92-220-157.customer.lyse.net) Quit (Max SendQ exceeded)
[12:01.02] <vonStrauss> yes.
[12:02.13] * Drew_ (~drew@2602:306:367f:b170:bcab:4f25:1ef6:8b13) Quit (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
[12:02.29] <cads> Dann20: lets step back a bit. do you agree that if   (a + b) converges, and c converges, then (a+b) + c converges?
[12:02.33] <cads> and why?
[12:02.38] * Bazzie (~0x2fab@68.235.130.115) Quit (Quit: you're in for wild ride, kid)
[12:02.46] <Dann20> Yes because of limit theorem
[12:02.56] * z0kk (~zarak@101.50.87.198) has joined channel ##math
[12:03.32] <vonStrauss> Good morning z0kk
[12:03.38] <very_anon_math> spudzee1111: you take the series expansion of both sides
[12:03.49] <cads> Dann20: do you agree that if   (a + b) converges, and -b, then  (a+b) - b converges? Does a converge in this case as well? why?
[12:04.00] <cads> -b converges*
[12:04.07] * Bazzie (~0x2fab@68.235.130.115) has joined channel ##math
[12:04.17] <Dann20> Yes because of limit theorem
[12:04.29] <Dann20> a and b must converge for a + b to converge
[12:04.30] <cads> that answers the first part
[12:04.35] <very_anon_math> supdzee1111: ＋＋http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_formula#Proofs，，
[12:04.49] <cads> Dann20: no
[12:05.04] <cads> a and b could both be divergent
[12:05.16] <cads> but we're saying only that their sum is convergent
[12:05.47] <cads> but if (a + b) is convergent, and b is convergent, I'm claiming we can show that a is convergent.
[12:05.47] <Dann20> Oh... okay
[12:05.58] * PlanckWalk (~Planck@ppp105-115.static.internode.on.net) Quit (Ping timeout: 264 seconds)
[12:06.42] <cads> because in that case,  the limit theorem says   (a+b) + (-b) is convergent
[12:06.52] <cads> but that is equal to a, so a must be convergent
[12:07.29] <cads> Dann20: it's okay if we gotta come at this problem later
[12:07.33] * z0kk (~zarak@101.50.87.198) Quit (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
[12:07.55] <Dann20> ＋＋http://mathb.in/27963，，
[12:07.58] <Dann20> So what am i missing?
[12:09.29] <cads> tell me what you think is missing
[12:09.53] <cads> where is our contradiction?

[12:11.12] * xrlk (~xrlk@216-58-27-26.cpe.distributel.net) Quit (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[12:11.19] <Dann20> Our contradiction is that Xn + Yn doesn't converge
[12:11.28] <Dann20> Or that Yn converges

[12:15.53] <cads> Dann20: our preconditions are that x converges and y diverses.    for the purpose of establishing a contradiction, our assumption is that x + y converges.    Using that assumption and the preconditions, we can come to the conclusion that y converges. But according to the preconditions, y diverges, Contradiction! Therefore our assumption is false: x + y diverges

[12:17.42] <Dann20> cads:  ＋＋http://mathb.in/27964，， getting closer?
[12:17.45] <walabe> i have a question i want to make sure is correct
[12:17.49] <cads> Dann20: that's the flow of a proof by contradiction. We start in a situation where we have some pre-established conditions. We make an assumption, and show that this assumption leads to a bad conclusion. Therefore we conclude the assumption is false.
[12:18.17] <walabe> for what values of x is the curve: y=x^4 -24x^2 +7? I have -2<x<2 I think is the answer
[12:18.21] <walabe> is this correct?
[12:18.29] <walabe> concave down*
[12:18.37] <walabe> what values is that concave down sorry
[12:19.00] <cads> Dann20: you have to save the url to show updates :)

[12:21.15] <very_anon_math> walabe: you look good - you used the second derivative right?
[12:21.37] <walabe> yes
[12:21.44] <Dann20> cads: better/
[12:21.45] <Dann20> ?
[12:21.50] <walabe> sweet thank you
[12:22.34] <cads> Dann20: does your book have a section explaining proof by contradiction?
[12:22.34] <Dann20> Umm
[12:22.53] <Dann20> Don't believe so
[12:23.41] <cads> it's crucial that you understand that, so I recommend finding some examples
[12:24.14] <walabe> what are you guys talking about
[12:25.22] <cads> walabe: dann is working on some analysis homework, proving that if  x_n is a convergent sequence and and y_n is a divergent sequent, then x_n + y_n is divergent sequence

[12:25.37] <Dann20> ＋＋http://mathb.in/27966，，
[12:25.42] <walabe> nice!
[12:25.42] <Dann20> Found an example in my notes
[12:25.56] <walabe> i have no idea what that is haha, what level of maths? university?
[12:26.28] <cads> Dann20: you have to fill in the details
[12:26.30] * z0kk (~zarak@101.50.87.198) has joined channel ##math
[12:26.51] <Dann20> Details?
[12:27.09] <cads> the limit theorem doesn't say that if  (x+y) and x are convergent then y is convergent
[12:27.14] <cads> it merely implies that
[12:27.40] <cads> that is, if x + y and x are two convergent series, we can use the limit theorem to show that y is convergent, but we have to do a little work to set it up
[12:28.01] <cads> that's what (x+y) - x = y is for
[12:28.04] * TheScholar (~randomman@ool-45716958.dyn.optonline.net) has joined channel ##math
[12:28.19] <cads> aside from that, the proof is nearly complete

[12:29.29] <cads> convince me that you know why the limit theorem implies y is convergent given that (x+y) and x are both convergent, and then I'll say you're done

[12:39.44] <Dann20> Yaaay!  :D
[12:39.45] <cads> Dann20: I separated the the base assumptions from the assumption made to establish contradiction, which is important for clarity

[12:40.19] <drazak> well
[12:40.24] <cads> I further explicitly stated the conclusion of the proof by contradiction, which is not always necessary but helpful
[12:40.35] <walabe> (n-5), (n-2) and (n-8) are 3 consecutive terms of a geometric progression. Find the values of n and the common ratio... does n = 4 and r/ratio = -2 ??

[12:40.59] <drazak> if x converges then there is some constant eps s.t. x + eps = 0
[12:41.25] <drazak> and if y converges the y+eps is some constant
[12:41.38] <Vornicus> walabe: looks right.

[12:42.26] <walabe> i'm just going to keep posting questions as i do them, for whoever wants to double check them for me... is that okay?
[12:42.31] <cads> Dann20: and added a couple technical details : I made explicit the claim that -x converges, though I didn't quote a theorem. I quoted the limit theorem to establish that (x + y) + (- x) = y converges

[12:44.07] <Dann20> cads: I just never would have been able to write it that nice and precise
[12:44.07] <cads> Dann20: enjoy
[12:44.35] <cads> I'm sure studying that (and other proofs) will help you increase your clarity
[12:44.49] <Dann20> I'll be sure to.
[12:44.52] <Dann20> Just have one left...
[12:44.53] <Dann20> haha

[12:45.18] <cads> especially where contradiction is concerned, it's very important to be precise and know what's going on
[12:45.43] <exaction> learning by listening in
[12:45.58] <brett1479> suppose f_n is a bounded sequence in L^1[0,1], and let g_n = Integral (t  = 0 to x) f_n(t) dt.  Then g_n has a convergent subsequence in L^2[0,1].
[12:46.21] <walabe> guys how do you find a gradient or slope of a line that makes a triangle, if you only know 2 angles
[12:46.22] * LogUse (~LogUse@190.190.32.227) Quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[12:47.02] <Dann20> ＋＋http://mathb.in/27969，，  I've been looking at this throughout the whole night
[12:48.29] <cads> just remember the format:    PR (Preconditions) -> AS (Assumption for sake of contradiction) -> R (Proof of contradiction) -> CON (Statement of negated AS).   So   PR -> AS -> R -> CON --- if your proof by assumption has these four parts you're on the right track
[12:49.32] <cads> Dann20: I wish you good luck with that one, but I'm gonna take a break from the channel for now
[12:50.07] <Dann20> cads: You've hung in there with me a lot longer than i had expected/had wished!
[12:50.12] <Dann20> cads: Thank you for that!

[12:51.43] * Pengoo (~Pengoo@S0106c8fb2681704d.vf.shawcable.net) Quit (Quit: number one in the hood g)
[12:51.43] <benzrf> Dann20: to be precise
[12:51.56] <benzrf> Dann20: in general, P -> False is equivalent to ~P
[12:52.08] <benzrf> Dann20: so if ~P -> False, then ~~P
[12:52.10] <benzrf> Dann20: so, P
[12:52.20] <benzrf> Dann20: meaning you can prove P by showing that ~P -> False
[12:52.36] <benzrf> of course this only works if you believe ~~P -> P ;)
[12:52.36] <cads> also,  A&~A ->
[12:52.38] <cads> err
[12:52.44] <walabe> Guys: ＋＋http://i.imgur.com/jAQTN83.png，， Looks really easy but I'm stuck
[12:52.45] <cads> A&~A -> False
[12:53.02] <cads> benzrf: shh! :)
[12:53.18] <benzrf> walabe: perhaps you would find it easier to find the slope of the reflected line, then reflect the slope
[12:53.38] <benzrf> (reflected over the horizontal axis i mean)

[12:53.42] <walabe> how do i find a slope with just the angles?

[12:54.28] <Dann20> benzrf: for the infinity proof?
[12:54.28] <cads> benzrf: I forget why we don't want to believe ~~p -> p. Probably because we can prove ~~p without producing an effective method of showing p?
[12:55.35] * gondalier (~gondalier@mobile-130-126-255-144.near.illinois.edu) Quit ()
[12:55.37] <supremegoblin> you can prove ~p with a truth table
[12:55.42] <very_anon_math> cads: isn't that constructivism?
[12:55.48] <benzrf> cads: well
[12:55.48] <walabe> very_anon_math: so it would be /-3
[12:55.49] * goodenough (~goodenoug@pool-108-13-13-188.lsanca.fios.verizon.net) Quit (Remote host closed the connection)
[12:55.51] <supremegoblin> same with ~~P
[12:55.52] <walabe> square root 3
[12:55.53] <cads> very_anon_math: yes
[12:56.09] <benzrf> cads: under the curry howard correspondence, ~P /literally/ means P -> False
[12:56.28] * Liebknecht (uid46333@gateway/web/irccloud.com/x-jjjbfyapmmdihtnv) Quit (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
[12:56.38] <benzrf> in the same way that 1010 /literally/ means 10
[12:56.45] <benzrf> (binary and decimal, sorry)
[12:57.00] <benzrf> cads: so ~~P means ((P -> False) -> False)
[12:57.19] <supremegoblin> think of it like a double negative lol
[12:57.24] * Haswell (~Haswell@unaffiliated/haswell) Quit (Quit: Saliendo)
[12:57.26] <benzrf> and "forall P, ~~P -> P" is "forall P, ((P -> False) -> False) -> P"

[01:02.08] <benzrf> cads: obviously "forall P, P -> ((P -> False) -> False)" is trivial to implement, and so double negation introduction is OK
[01:02.14] <cads> so if we have a function   f : P -> False, then this means P is the inhabited type as well, since the inhabited type is initial?

[01:03.24] <benzrf> now write an expression of type P
[01:03.39] <benzrf> do this in a way that is parametrically polymorphic over all P
[01:03.50] <benzrf> then you have an implementation of forall P, ((P -> False) -> False) -> P
[01:04.10] <cads> benzrf: I'm guessing that the uninhabited type is an initial object in the category of types, so that if we have some f: p -> false, then p must be an initial object as well
[01:04.19] <cads> ie, it'd be isomorphic to the uninhabited type
[01:04.24] <benzrf> but cads
[01:04.28] <benzrf> you dont have P -> False

[01:06.15] <benzrf> i mean intuitively anything with a function to  is also empty, so it's clearly an initial object by the same proof as False
[01:06.26] <cads> so saying   (P -> False) -> False is saying that the number of arrows from P to False is zero. In other words P is not initial, so it is inhabited
[01:06.33] <benzrf> i suppose

[01:11.08] <ski> benzrf : universe ?
[01:11.17] <cads> A v (A -> False)   I get : it's the statement that we have an inhabited type consisting of the union of A along with the arrows from A to false.
[01:11.17] <benzrf> ski: hm?
[01:11.37] <benzrf> cads: well
[01:11.38] <cads> I have a hard time seeing how that type could be uninhabited
[01:11.39] <benzrf> ah yes
[01:11.48] <cads> but supposing
[01:11.52] <benzrf> cads: well, it's uninhabited for LEM :)
[01:12.04] <benzrf> ~LEM is uninhabited and so is LEM
[01:12.28] <ski> cads : it's the statement (for a particular given `A', say), that we have decided whether `A' is true or `A' is not true (iow false)
[01:12.35] <cads> isn't LEM  the statement that   A v (A -> False) is  inhabited
[01:12.35] <cads> ?
[01:12.39] <benzrf> cads: yes
[01:12.41] <benzrf> :D
[01:12.49] <benzrf> cads: well, no
[01:13.05] <cads> oh no, ski's on da scene!
[01:13.06] <ski> LEM is the universal closure of that, over any `A'
[01:13.08] <cads> sup, ski?
[01:13.17] <benzrf> cads: constructively, a statement of inhabitation must provide an actual inhabitant
[01:13.18] <cads> ah, right
[01:13.21] <ski> cads : inf
[01:13.48] <benzrf> cads: so LEM is the type of a function from a proposition to either a proof or disproof of that prop
[01:13.51] <sylow1> G is a p-group of order p^2. Suppose |Z(G)| = p. Then, G/Z(G) is isomorphic to Z_g (the cyclic group of order p). Why is G abelian from here? I understand that cyclic groups are abelian. Does it mean that G/Z(G) is cyclic?
[01:14.55] <benzrf> cads: intuitively a proof of P is giving an inhabitant of P, while a proof of ~~P is showing that it would be absurd for P to be absurd
[01:15.02] <benzrf> er, for P to be uninhabited, i guess?
[01:15.08] * z0kk (~zarak@101.50.87.198) has joined channel ##math
[01:16.06] <benzrf> so LEM cannot be proven because you can't actually implement such a function, but ~~LEM is OK because it would be silly for such a function to be undefinable in a classical sense
[01:16.08] <benzrf> ...kinda
[01:17.32] <cads> benzrf: so  f : A v (A -> False) is an inhabitant of A or Hom(A, B), but I'm having a hard time seeing why it would be hard to produce f for any known inhabited A. Similarly, if we know A is uninhabited, it should be easy to produce such f.
[01:17.42] <cads> I guess there's a third case
[01:17.46] <benzrf> cads: ah, but!
[01:18.10] <benzrf> LEM = forall P, P \/ ~P
[01:18.11] <cads> where we don't know if A is either inhabited or uninhabited

[01:19.26] <cads> benzrf: oh shait, you are asking for a process that either produces an inhabitant or proof that such inhabitant doesn't exist...
[01:19.34] <cads> for _any_ type
[01:19.38] <benzrf> yep
[01:19.46] <benzrf> 01:17:51         benzrf │ cads: forall is a function type
[01:19.53] <cads> sounds like halting function country
[01:19.58] <benzrf> indeed
[01:20.23] <benzrf> cads: remember; classically you can apply the LEM to do case analysis on a proposition's truth value
[01:20.38] <benzrf> in constructive logic, there are no truth values, only inhabitance
[01:20.46] <cads> so it's the function type quantifying the local LEM over all types that ends up being uninhabited

[01:21.25] <ski> (another way to think about it is : there are truth-values, but you can't do case analysis on them)
[01:21.26] <benzrf> you can't prove that though
[01:21.31] <benzrf> at least, not within the logic
[01:21.36] <benzrf> so LEM is consistent with it
[01:21.57] <benzrf> from the outside, it's clear that ~(LEM \/ ~LEM) since you can't prove either within the logic
[01:22.04] <benzrf> so it looks like LEM should be inconsistent with it
[01:22.12] <benzrf> but from the inside, you can't actually prove ~(LEM \/ ~LEM)
[01:22.14] <benzrf> so it's safe!
[01:22.34] <cads> so we know LEM is an uninhabited function type, but the logic doesn't know that?

[01:41.22] <Minimoa> If a > 0
[01:41.44] <walabe> can someone help
[01:41.45] <walabe> explain why y= x^3 + 3 is an increasing function except at x=0"
[01:41.46] <drazak> Cale: huh
[01:41.54] <sylow1> ok, i figured it out
[01:42.01] <drazak> i really need to learn category theory
[01:42.23] <Minimoa> walabe: Check it's slope on every point
[01:42.26] <Minimoa> it's never negative
[01:42.47] <walabe> okay thanks

[01:43.24] <cads> walabe: that function is monotonically increasing everywhere, but x=0 is a critical point
[01:43.28] <sylow1> If p is a prime number, then the only group with p elements is the cyclic group Cp.

[01:44.33] <cads> I actually think f(x) = x^3 + 3 is strictly increasting, since a  < b implies  f(a) < f(b), even if a or b is 0.
[01:44.35] <walabe> critical point = stationary point? cads
[01:44.46] <cads> walabe: right
[01:45.01] <walabe> okay thanks!!
[01:45.10] <Minimoa>  If a^x^3 > (1/a)^(x+1) and x^3 + x + 1 < 0 have same solution, this means that x^3 < -x -1, so a^x^3 < a^(-x-1) ?
[01:46.03] <Minimoa> for a > 0
[01:46.20] <@Cale> drazak: There's a really nice answer here: ＋＋http://mathoverflow.net/a/22938，， I think we have a long way to go to really start taking as much advantage as we could with regard to writing results once and using logical tools to generalise results for free, but yeah, the first step is just to pay attention to when we really need LEM and AC and when we can get by without them.

[08:28.24] <vonStrauss> day traders are gay raiders
[08:32.26] <Guest12657> vonStrauss, it's an evil nazi conspiracy
[08:36.12] <skyra`> only the classiest in this channel
[08:36.49] <vonStrauss> skyra`: that's because day traders
[08:36.49] <Guest12657> skyra`, :)
[08:37.16] <vonStrauss> Day traders have on average a very low IQ and almost always engage in petty crime, according to a source that might
[08:37.19] <vonStrauss> be tru
[08:37.20] <vonStrauss> e
[08:37.32] <skyra`> i missed an opportunity to make a classism joke drat
[08:37.42] <vonStrauss> I'll give you a beat

[08:38.44] <vonStrauss> Are you?
[08:38.46] <vonStrauss> How about that
[08:38.54] <vonStrauss> a day trader who likes his potatoes
[08:38.55] <vonStrauss> Ha ha ha
[08:38.58] <vonStrauss> How about that now
[08:39.06] <skyra`> two incorrect assumptions
[08:39.55] <vonStrauss> English doesn't have gender neutral human third person possesive pronouns, sooo uh don't blame me mate
[08:40.05] <vonStrauss> And as for the day trader, then my mistake
[08:40.15] <vonStrauss> And if potatoes was one of them, then okay 
[08:40.46] <skyra`> ;p
[08:41.22] <vonStrauss> anyway if you truly are a meat and potatoes kind of person, then surely you will take apart an argument without looking to petty incorrect assumptions
[08:43.01] <skyra`> that is a matter of personal inclination towards taking apart said argument of which i have very little

[08:50.44] <Knunez> yo
[08:50.46] <djoi298> which probably means most people will get into multi-year contracts with the phone service companies just to get the discount

[08:50.58] <@wintax> djoi298: yeah, so?
[08:51.31] <@wintax> i don't know why people hate on contracts.  how often do you really need to switch carriers
[08:51.35] <MrCleanWithHair> djoi298:  ＋＋http://aaplinvestors.net/stats/iphone/pricing/，，
[08:51.37] <djoi298> so prices of phones are inflating
[08:51.39] <+EconBot> Title: iPhone US Pricing History : AAPLinvestors (at aaplinvestors.net)
[08:51.58] <djoi298> aren't the suppose to be falling with more competition?
[08:52.11] <Knunez> more competition? there is less now than ever
[08:52.13] <@wintax> not necessarily
[08:52.22] <Knunez> just 4 carriers, and 2 are really rounding errors in terms of marketshare
[08:52.36] <@wintax> there are more, you just don't hear about them
[08:52.44] <gde33> contracts make the business much less risky, can do the job cheaper

[08:53.56] * maletor (~maletor@unaffiliated/maletor) Quit (Quit: Computer has gone to sleep.)
[08:54.34] <djoi298> i mean with phone manufacturers
[08:55.00] <MrCleanWithHair> look at price per some unit of performance
[08:55.02] <@wintax> what do you mean.  be more clear
[08:55.17] <@wintax> most people buy phones from the carrier, so that's the price you are likely referring to
[08:55.30] <djoi298> shouldn't the actual phones start to become cheaper now with more phone manufacturing?
[08:55.57] <@wintax> you are assuming demand stays constant
[08:56.03] <mondo_kims> and quality.
[08:56.13] <djoi298> Moto, Samsung, Apple, HTC, LG, OnePlus, Huwei... etc
[08:56.29] <vonStrauss> huwei huwei hu

[08:56.53] <@wintax> djoi298: you are assuming demand and quality stays constant
[08:57.08] <djoi298> what could be the reason phones prices are rising?
[08:57.09] <@wintax> does it? (hint: no)
[08:57.15] <vonStrauss> No, kia?
[08:58.30] <djoi298> wintax, most Americans had smartphones years ago, the demand in the US is probably constant, maybe even falling
[08:58.58] <MrCleanWithHair> djoi298: india? china?
[08:59.32] <@wintax> djoi298: wrong.  do you not realize how often people replace or break their phones?
[08:59.32] <djoi298> but they usually buy domestic cheaper brand versions, don't they?
[08:59.55] <@wintax> djoi298: look at the actual iphone or other phone sales.  guess what, they've gone up
[09:00.12] <Knunez> even in the US 
[09:00.18] <djoi298> yeah, mostly from Asia
[09:00.21] <mondo_kims> djoi298: what exactly are you arguing?
[09:00.26] <Knunez> like you said, contracts... well, they only last 2 years, and most tend to upgrade after 2
[09:00.34] <@wintax> if they even make it that long
[09:00.51] * Monie (~Monie@cpe-071-076-159-155.triad.res.rr.com) has joined channel ##economics
[09:01.09] <MrCleanWithHair> don't forget carriers are offering the pay a percentage of the phone price every month and upgrade after X months plans now too
[09:02.20] <djoi298> does anyone even buy phones at full retail price these days? 
[09:02.40] <Knunez> some do, yes
[09:02.50] <Knunez> those who don't want to be tied down on a contracy
[09:02.51] <Knunez> t
[09:03.02] <mondo_kims> it's actually slightly cheaper, i think.
[09:03.08] <@wintax> MrCleanWithHair: some also offer to buy you out of your current contract too
[09:03.09] <vonStrauss> gde33: why did japan crash in the late 80s

[09:06.02] <vonStrauss> Knunez: well that's good, that's nice
[09:06.07] <@wintax> mondo_kims: something i'm not too clear on - interest rate sensitivity of preferred stock?

[09:06.51] <@wintax> i'm looking at the S&P US preferred stock index
[09:07.09] <djoi298> so is oil still plummeting in price? lol
[09:07.10] * nfk (~nfk@unaffiliated/nfk) Quit (Quit: yawn)
[09:07.14] * maletor (~maletor@unaffiliated/maletor) has joined channel ##economics
[09:07.49] <mondo_kims> i've never checked.
[09:08.08] <djoi298> so if smartphones are becoming more expensive because there is more demand, does that mean that oil prices are down because of lower demand?
[09:08.44] <mondo_kims> but uhh, i'd guess it depends on how it's structured?
[09:09.48] <djoi298> ?
[09:09.51] <@wintax> yeah i haven't put meaningful thought into it
[09:10.19] <mondo_kims> even equity prices are affected by interest rates, sooo...
[09:10.24] * mondo_kims shrugs
[09:10.59] <mondo_kims> do you have a particular issue in mind?
[09:11.08] <@wintax> yeah
[09:11.16] <@wintax> ishares has a preferred etf that pays monthly at a rate of around 6%
[09:11.29] <@wintax> seems good for some clients
[09:11.41] <@wintax> but trying to assess the interest rate risk vis-a-vis bonds
[09:12.15] <mondo_kims> that's not an ETF i'd like to own.
[09:13.07] <mondo_kims> or at least that's my initial reaction.
[09:13.25] <@wintax> what am i missing
[09:14.54] * Dr-G (~Dr-G@unaffiliated/dr-g) Quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[09:15.08] <mondo_kims> my gut says they probably have to make some liquidity restrictions since it's a little bit esoteric and not all issues are widely traded.
[09:15.15] * Dr-G (~Dr-G@gtng-4d08a3cd.pool.mediaways.net) has joined channel ##economics

[09:15.15] * Dr-G (~Dr-G@unaffiliated/dr-g) has joined channel ##economics
[09:15.34] <mondo_kims> so they either have to pay a premium for that liquidity or they can stuck with low liquidity securities.
[09:15.51] <mondo_kims> can get *

[09:15.59] <vonStrauss> you like da liquidity trap

[09:16.11] <vonStrauss> what is trappier middle incomet trap or liquidity trap
[09:16.24] <vonStrauss> if you had to be in a trap which one would you trap yourself in
[09:16.28] * Niebuhr (~p@host86-129-195-225.range86-129.btcentralplus.com) Quit (Quit: Leaving)
[09:16.41] <mondo_kims> and it's an S&P index, so they probably have minimum liquidity requirements.
[09:16.49] <@wintax> that is a valid point
[09:17.02] <@wintax> you mean liquidity of the underlying preferreds
[09:17.02] <mondo_kims> that seems to be their thing with their smallcap and midcap indices and all that.
[09:17.13] <mondo_kims> ＋＋https://us.spindices.com/documents/methodologies/methodology-sp-us-preferred-stock-index.pdf?force_download=true，，
[09:17.15] <@wintax> because the etf itself is plenty liquid
[09:17.17] <mondo_kims> yea
[09:18.00] <vonStrauss> i need some liquidity to diversify my cash savings portfolio
[09:18.07] <djoi298> what is the average return people get from ETFs?
[09:18.11] <vonStrauss> 7.
[09:18.15] <mondo_kims> The index is rebalanced on a quarterly basis;
[09:18.17] <vonStrauss> Just kidding, I don't know offhand.
[09:18.19] <mondo_kims> that sounds bad too.
[09:18.41] <mondo_kims> predictable rebalancing of large funds/indices is basically handing money over to arbitraguers.
[09:18.44] <vonStrauss> but seriously you guys know where I might get some liquidity to diversify my cash savings investment fund
[09:18.46] <@wintax> index rebalance?

[09:28.55] <mondo_kims> sometimes it out performs.
[09:29.01] <mondo_kims> sometimes it doesn't.
[09:29.17] <mondo_kims> but the turnover is always higher.
[09:29.39] <@wintax> equal weighted is interesting
[09:29.53] <@wintax> im not sold on its merits, but i do find market cap weighted flawed
[09:30.13] <mondo_kims> every system has it's advantages and flaws.
[09:31.19] <@wintax> one that is earnings or cash flow weighted sounds nice
[09:31.46] <mondo_kims> i think an interesting idea is equal weighting sectors with market cap weighted indices.
[09:32.51] <djoi298> does capital gains tax adjust for inflation/deflation?
[09:33.16] <mondo_kims> no.
[09:33.32] <djoi298> that sucks lol
[09:33.35] <@wintax> lol what
[09:33.37] <mondo_kims> why?
[09:33.46] <@wintax> no tax 'adjusts to inflation'
[09:34.04] <djoi298> because doesn't the central bank have a target inflation rate?
[09:34.12] <mondo_kims> so?
[09:34.14] <@wintax> what does that have to do with a tax?
[09:34.38] <@wintax> taxes are already expressed as %s, how else do you expect it to adjust?
[09:35.05] <apoplexy> [21:34] <apoplexy> what are some things in terms of features/functions i should be looking for on my business site
[09:35.05] <apoplexy> [21:34] <apoplexy> i have opt-in areas for e-mails, a blog -- any other ideas for useful things?
[09:35.08] <apoplexy> any input boyz?
[09:35.18] <apoplexy> drafting a specifications sheet for my designer
[09:35.25] <djoi298> so i guess that means the government is getting automatic tax money on the amount of inflation the central bank targets?
[09:36.08] <mondo_kims> ehhhh what?
[09:36.28] <mondo_kims> you're going to have to step through the logic of that one.
[09:36.30] <@wintax> wtf
[09:36.39] <djoi298> ok
[09:36.46] <apoplexy> djoi298 is creative as hell
[09:38.41] <djoi298> so if you had $1 million and the central bank inflation target was 2% or something then even if your stock did nothing and you cash out you would be forced to pay capital gains tax on 2% of your investment
[09:38.57] <djoi298> ?
[09:39.15] <@wintax> you would pay tax on your gain, not your 'investment'
[09:39.23] <@wintax> what is the gain in your scenario?
[09:39.30] <mondo_kims> if you have $1m at the start and $1m at the end, you pay the capital gains rate on your $0 gain.
[09:39.44] <djoi298> well obviously the stock would rise by 2% right?
[09:39.52] <@wintax> obviously?
[09:39.55] <mondo_kims> that's not obvious at all.
[09:39.55] <@wintax> no

[09:40.32] <djoi298> even if the central bank inflation target is 2% or something 
[09:41.08] <@wintax> that has virtually nothing to do with stock prices
[09:41.21] <mondo_kims> stocks don't appreciate/depreciate in price according to the federal reserve inflation target.
[09:41.56] <mondo_kims> bonds don't even do that, eventhough anticipated inflation is a major factor in bond pricing.
[09:41.56] <apoplexy> yes they do
[09:42.02] <apoplexy> ignore mondo_kims, he doesnt know anything
[09:42.04] <djoi298> well take a commodity like crude oil then instead
[09:42.12] <apoplexy> :]
[09:42.20] <mondo_kims> ok
[09:42.26] <mondo_kims> let's take crude oil.
[09:42.27] <mondo_kims> !oil
[09:42.33] <+EconBot> mondo_kims:  Crude Oil (WTI)  51.84 +0.60%  Crude Oil (Brent)  60.65 +0.17%  NYMEX Natural Gas  2.78 +0.47%

[09:42.34] <mondo_kims> it was about twice that a year ago.
[09:42.50] <mondo_kims> did the fed change their inflation target to -50%?
[09:43.05] <djoi298> obviously there are a lot of factors that influence prices
[09:43.18] <mondo_kims> there certainly are. :]
[09:43.21] <@wintax> djoi298: just how do you expect a tax to adjust to inflation?
[09:43.24] <djoi298> i'm just talking about one factor
[09:43.30] <@wintax> djoi298: let's start with that ^
[09:43.39] <@wintax> how do you expect it to work, in your mind
[09:43.46] <djoi298> i don't know, which is why i asked

[09:44.15] <mondo_kims> wintax: i think he expects all prices to rise by 2% and then the IRS to come and tax that 2% gain.
[09:44.44] <@wintax> lol
[09:44.48] <@wintax> is that it, djoi298 ?
[09:44.52] <mondo_kims> forget the issue that not all assets move in line with inflation and that inflation isn't at the fed target.
[09:44.53] <djoi298> but if it is the government target for say 2% inflation then 2% of your $1 million will be liable for taxes if all other prices factors remain constant
[09:45.04] <@wintax> yeah, and forget that taxes are applied as %s already
[09:45.08] * crayon (~user@unaffiliated/button) has joined channel ##economics
[09:45.42] <djoi298> mondo_kims, if assets don't move with the central banks inflation target, then what is the point of their target?
[09:46.05] <@wintax> djoi298: you dont seem to be grasping that the capital gains tax is a tax on gains
[09:46.10] <mondo_kims> the target is based on a measure of consumer expenditures, not on asset prices.
[09:46.21] <@wintax> not the $1M investment, but what it gained
[09:46.36] <djoi298> wintax, yeah, and you just said that capital gains don't account for inflation/deflation
[09:46.56] <@wintax> correct
[09:47.01] <mondo_kims> heh
[09:47.12] <mondo_kims> oh boy.
[09:47.38] <djoi298> so if there is a government 2% inflation tax gains will still be taxed because they don't care if it is from their inflation target
[09:48.03] <djoi298> i mean target not tax
[09:48.18] <mondo_kims> they don't target stock prices.
[09:48.27] * coffeeee (~coffeeee@cpe-174-103-113-161.columbus.res.rr.com) Quit (Ping timeout: 244 seconds)
[09:48.35] <mondo_kims> they don't target corporate bonds or housing prices.
[09:48.59] <@wintax> if you are suggesting that the government is using inflation to extort tax revenue from capital gains, you can rest easy because that's not true
[09:49.00] <djoi298> mondo_kims, how would they target that anyways? 
[09:49.15] * Xanather (~Xanather@unaffiliated/xanather) has joined channel ##economics
[09:49.30] <djoi298> wintax, i don't care what their intentions are, i am just interested in the logic
[09:49.30] <mondo_kims> djoi298: if you really want to know, read about how the core PCE index is calculated and how the data is gathered.
[09:49.36] <mondo_kims> that is the measure of inflation the fed uses.
[09:49.52] <@wintax> the fed also officially doesn't have an inflation target
[09:50.00] * mmealling (~mmealling@2601:0:a500:3d1:178:6822:9a04:920c) has joined channel ##economics
[09:50.08] <@wintax> unofficially though, 2% is about what they like to see
[09:50.15] <djoi298> isn't it like 2 to 3% inflation per year or something?
[09:50.24] <@wintax> what did i just say
[09:50.35] <djoi298> i have been saying that before you lol
[09:50.37] <Xanather> i think most central banks like it between 2-3.5%
[09:50.54] <justanotheruser> anyone know of a study comparing economic performance between gold based currencies and fiat currencies?
[09:51.14] <mondo_kims> ＋＋http://www.bea.gov/scb/pdf/national/nipa/methpap/methpap6.pdf，，
[09:51.15] <mondo_kims> enjoy.
[09:52.21] <gde33> you can always buy real fiat money for your gold coins
[09:52.23] <mondo_kims> the fed uses the core PCE index, which excludes food and energy.
[09:52.25] <Xanather> i dont think any gold based currencies have existed since the bretton woods system
[09:52.56] <mondo_kims> justanotheruser: performance in terms of what?
[09:52.58] <justanotheruser> gde33: its not pegged though
[09:53.12] <@wintax> collapse of bretton woods yeah
[09:53.22] <justanotheruser> mondo_kims: economic growth OR HDI growth
[09:53.24] <gde33> justanotheruser: but what to peg gold on?
[09:53.25] <mondo_kims> if you mean use as currency/money, the US dollar is currently not tied to gold and is the most widely used and trusted money ever to have existed.
[09:53.35] <justanotheruser> gde33: gold isn't pegged
[09:53.41] <@wintax> yeah lol
[09:53.48] <@wintax> justanotheruser: no study needed. fiat wins
[09:54.01] <Xanather> wintax why?
[09:54.12] <gde33> justanotheruser: you are just limiting money supply to the amount of gold
[09:54.13] <mondo_kims> more than 80% of all forex transactions involve the dollar.
[09:54.23] <Knunez> and switching from fiat back to a gold standard would ensue an inflation that would be unsustainable 
[09:54.24] <@wintax> Xanather: why what?
[09:54.28] <justanotheruser> mondo_kims: widely trusted is unrelated
[09:54.30] <mondo_kims> it's actually closer to 90%, i believe.
[09:54.32] <djoi298> Xanather, so if the central banks inflation target is 3.5% then basically the government is taxing $35,000 gains of every $1 million of your investments every year, guaranteed tax income! lol
[09:54.33] <gde33> justanotheruser: I suppose that if you do it on a large enough scale the price of gold goes up :D
[09:54.52] <Xanather> gjoi298 yep lol
[09:54.53] <mondo_kims> eh.
[09:54.59] <@wintax> djoi298: for the 18th time, the gains are taxed, not your investment
[09:55.03] * wintax facepalm
[09:55.07] <mondo_kims> djoi298: i think you're confused about how inflation and the tax system works.
[09:55.11] <Xanather> though in sane economic environments there would be proper interest rates to cover the inflation
[09:55.18] <Xanather> cough cough
[09:55.30] <djoi298> wintax, what is 3.5% gain of $1 million?
[09:55.38] * DilloYoda (~Kurt@99-19-22-123.lightspeed.hstntx.sbcglobal.net) has joined channel ##economics
[09:55.45] <justanotheruser> wintax: that seems like a silly statement
[09:55.47] <@wintax> djoi298: you're assuming that gain automatically incurred because of the inflation which is false
[09:55.58] <@wintax> djoi298: which we told you
[09:56.01] <Xanather> wintax, why flat is better than gold backed system
[09:56.04] <mondo_kims> yea, you're not taxed until you realize your gain.
[09:56.06] <Knunez> the US is far from a sane economic environment though, some of the recovery is fluff to be honest 
[09:56.14] <Knunez> the growth back has been painfully slow
[09:56.14] <djoi298> wintax, i asked what is 3.5% gain of $1 million?
[09:56.33] <mondo_kims> djoi298: if you don't sell that $1m investment, you don't pay taxes.
[09:56.36] <Xanather> wintax, fiat*
[09:56.37] <mondo_kims> you haven't realized any gains.
[09:56.41] <gde33> Knunez: what anti-american thing to say!
[09:56.50] <@wintax> Xanather: because fiat allows for control over the money supply to moderate the economy?

[09:57.02] <djoi298> mondo_kims, that doesn't matter because the central bank inflation target has already occured
[09:57.07] <Knunez> mondo_kims, which is why I dont think high capital gains is much of a good idea
[09:57.12] <gde33> Knunez: you have to embrace the communist collectivism and stop thinking for yourself, all will be fine :P
[09:57.26] <mondo_kims> eh.
[09:57.36] <mondo_kims> there's a lot to be said about how capital gains work.
[09:57.44] <mondo_kims> i'm not sure anyone is happy with it. :P
[09:58.02] <mondo_kims> regardless of whether you think we should be paying more or less.
[09:58.12] <Knunez> if your purpose if to get the rich to pay their "fair share", sure, it works, but if you want a steady supply of revenue, you'll start seeing decreases in revenue at a certain point 
[09:58.16] <@wintax> djoi298: the two concepts are unrelated, so you can stop forcing a relation and thinking this is some conspiracy
[09:58.39] <Knunez> its not like income taxes where the only way to escape is to break the law, you simply don't sell, and wait out an eventual decrease in rate
[09:58.58] <gde33> there is no law, only guidelines
[09:59.02] <@wintax> um
[09:59.13] <@wintax> taxes are about the lowest now as they've ever been
[09:59.20] <djoi298> wintax, what does it mean exactly when the central bank targets an inflation rate? do they want to raise all prices by their inflation target or something?
[09:59.51] <@wintax> djoi298: mondo_kims provided you with the PCE, they look at that.  not asset prices
[09:59.53] <gde33> wintax: it's crazy in the us, alkihol taxed in cents per gallon? pot less than 1 buck per gram?

[10:00.10] <Xanather> djoi298 the generate price "increase" in goods and services over a period of time is usually a good definition
[10:00.13] <Knunez> yes, but revenue is bleeding because of loopholes left and right
[10:00.18] <djoi298> wintax, i won't understand it, just tell me
[10:00.19] <Knunez> an increase in taxes wouldn't do much good
[10:00.24] <Xanather> anyone who knows anything though is that its the increase in the money supply but
[10:00.33] <Xanather> banks have to keep lending, can't go deflationary in this system
[10:00.35] <Knunez> but maybe I'm too cynical in regards to how rich people pay taxes
[10:01.02] <djoi298> the rich don't pay taxes lol
[10:01.05] <gde33> they have people for that too
[10:01.08] <mondo_kims> i think last year i paid about 1% of my tax bill a couple years ago.
[10:01.08] <@wintax> djoi298: ...
[10:01.13] <Knunez> thats true
[10:01.14] <gde33> they pay tax in people lolol
[10:01.15] <Knunez> lol
[10:01.15] <mondo_kims> or 3 years ago i mean?
[10:01.27] <mondo_kims> my taxes are a mess.
[10:01.29] <djoi298> hey wintax, i won't understand it, just tell me
[10:01.51] * burnside (uid44733@gateway/web/irccloud.com/x-ebkalohcrgzemiek) has joined channel ##economics
[10:02.02] <mondo_kims> djoi298: you won't understand if he tells either, evidently, heh.
[10:02.07] <mondo_kims> tells you*
[10:02.28] <mondo_kims> well, 1% for federal.
[10:02.43] <gde33> nick hanauer was funny with his remark that boiled down to "I earn more in this conversation than I pay in tax per year"
[10:02.44] <Xanather> its safe to assume in the US that much of the government has been brought out by corporation interests, so then the tax loopholes don't get fixed and nothing gets stricter
[10:02.46] <mondo_kims> i think it was more like 10% overall.
[10:03.03] <Xanather> people who deny it are delusional
[10:03.17] <Knunez> the only people who deny it are those who are in on it
[10:03.18] <djoi298> Democracy sucks lol
[10:03.19] <gde33> *the end*
[10:03.29] <Knunez> seems like a pretty common viewpoint to have nowadays
[10:03.29] <mondo_kims> Xanather: oddly enough, the US has pretty high corporate tax rates.
[10:03.41] <Knunez> because no one pays 35%
[10:03.41] <mondo_kims> even if you look at effective rates.
[10:03.47] <justanotheruser> Xanather: that is partially why I am wondering about the performance of gold currency vs fiat
[10:03.51] <djoi298> Democracy makes it easier for corrupt government taking advantage of the people
[10:03.56] <gde33> Knunez: how is it a view point?
[10:04.07] <justanotheruser> the people here will say black and white "YOU DONT NEED NUMBERS, FIAT WINS"
[10:04.18] <@wintax> djoi298: it's clear to me i can't change your view
[10:04.24] <Knunez> well if anything it should be a fact by now, some of the corruption is pretty cut and dry 
[10:04.33] <gde33> djoi298: I blame enablers
[10:04.35] <djoi298> Democracy = majority rule Dictatorship since 51% of the people can make laws the remaining 49% by must
[10:04.39] <justanotheruser> but if fiat only grows an economy slightly faster, perhaps that justifies allowing the govt less control over the monetary suply
[10:04.43] <mondo_kims> Xanather: american corporations pay more than corporations in progressive sweden.
[10:04.50] <djoi298> OBEY
[10:04.53] <djoi298> :)
[10:04.53] <Knunez> djoi298, which is why the US isnt a democracy
[10:04.55] <mondo_kims> pay a higher rate i should say.
[10:05.03] <Knunez> we've had presidents who have won with a minority
[10:05.03] <@wintax> holy crap
[10:05.05] <justanotheruser> mondo_kims: but what is capital gains in sweden?
[10:05.10] <mondo_kims> i'm not sure.
[10:05.10] <@wintax> where did all you conspiros suddenly come from tonight?
[10:05.15] <Knunez> did you fail your civics class?

[02:30.49] <de_jean_7777> or explodes,  I dunno
[02:30.56] <de_jean_7777> perhaps cortana shits her pants :D

[02:31.27] <Rainbot> Title: 50 Shades Of Halo - Imgur (at imgur.com)
[02:31.32] <MagicBadgers> speaking of cortana being a her, i'm surprised there isn't anything more visual with it
[02:31.33] --shodan45-- logged in with account (shodan45)
[02:32.23] <de_jean_7777> siri doesn't have anything visual about her either
[02:32.30] <de_jean_7777> best not have anything
[02:32.41] <de_jean_7777> can use your imagination to attach something to the voice
[02:33.10] <de_jean_7777> except with cortana, I always attach the cortana from Halo
[02:33.23] <MagicBadgers> is it really better to have nothing?
[02:33.52] <MagicBadgers> or even better, people like to 'customise' things
[02:34.06] <de_jean_7777> well, the option to customise should be added
[02:34.14] <de_jean_7777> but if there is no option, then best to have nothing
[02:34.18] <de_jean_7777> there is the vocie
[02:34.20] <de_jean_7777> voice*
[02:35.00] <de_jean_7777> if you add a visual image, you can't attach anything of your own in your mind
[02:35.15] <de_jean_7777> this way, you can attach your waifu or whatever to the voice :D
[02:49.06] <Iota> <MagicBadgers> speaking of cortana being a her, i'm surprised there isn't anything more visual with it
[02:49.23] <Iota> Cortana is the hologram from the Halo series. There is a lot of visuals.
[02:49.29] <MagicBadgers> i'm aware
[02:49.42] <MagicBadgers> but yeah, just a bunch of circles in the windows version
[02:50.04] <Iota> Oh right, you mean the actual feature on the OS.
[02:50.07] <MagicBadgers> yeah
[02:50.59] <Iota> Yeah, true. Though I prefer the idea of a voice without any visuals. I'd feel like a kid if I was talking to a moving picture.
[02:51.51] <MagicBadgers> without pictures it can't give you a cheeky grin when you ask it to look for porn...
[02:51.54] <MagicBadgers> lol
[02:52.45] <de_jean_7777> lol
[02:52.48] <Iota> "Everyone running Windows 7 or 8.1, irrespective of whether you pirated the operating system or not, will be allowed to upgrade to a legitimate version of Windows 10."
[02:53.04] <MagicBadgers> strange
[02:53.21] <MagicBadgers> that's really strange
[02:53.23] <de_jean_7777> Yay, I'm gonna get 10 for freeeeee
[02:53.43] <MagicBadgers> that means windows 10 is free for everyone
[02:53.46] <PopeJob> its the new linux!
[02:53.51] <Iota> \o/
[02:53.59] <MagicBadgers> so why not just make a basic free version?
[02:54.00] <MagicBadgers> lol
[02:54.05] <Iota> 2015 the year for Desktop Windows gaming!
[02:54.09] <MagicBadgers> given that's effectively what it is
[02:54.43] <de_jean_7777> it's the new linux with actual working graphical environment
[02:54.57] <Iota> "It isn't clear if Myerson's comments only pertain to China, or to all Windows users worldwide. We have reached out to Microsoft for clarification, but haven't yet heard back. Myerson's wording certainly sounds like this will affect all Windows users worldwide."
[02:55.14] <de_jean_7777> with such advanced features like "not getting a kernel panic cause nouveau crapped its pants" and "can actually do vsync"
[02:55.30] <PopeJob> "sound working with flash"
[02:55.34] <PopeJob> :oo
[02:55.43] <Iota> I will not install Flash.
[02:55.43] <PopeJob> I'd pirate that
[02:56.04] <MagicBadgers> yeah vsync doesn't always work
[02:56.10] <MagicBadgers> particularly with intel
[02:56.17] <PopeJob> would be so great to leave flash behind already
[02:56.22] <Iota> "ZDNet's Ed Bott got a response from a Microsoft spokesperson, confirming that the free upgrade path is indeed available for all pirates everywhere, and not just in China."
[02:56.51] <Iota> I should just read the entire article before copy pasting in the future.
[02:57.01] <MagicBadgers> see this is weird
[02:57.13] <MagicBadgers> if this is true it's convoluted
[02:57.28] <MagicBadgers> at that point might as well just offer a stripped down windows 10 iso for free
[02:57.48] <PopeJob> that's what they 'll do, i bet
[02:57.49] <Iota> Why stripped down? What's wrong with them giving away the OS? 
[02:57.55] <de_jean_7777> it'll probably require registration
[02:57.55] <PopeJob> you'll have to pay for updates
[02:58.03] <MagicBadgers> Iota: because they have to make money somehow
[02:58.13] <Iota> They're losing OS marketshare year by year, they need to do something to gain it back. This is their something.
[02:58.29] <MagicBadgers> this is why strip it down
[02:58.42] <Iota> I'm not convinced their OS sales are a very big percentage of their overall income.
[02:59.47] <Iota> Even if it is stripped down, it's not stopping pirates from pirating a "full" version. They're just trying to gain more popularity with the average home user.
[03:00.45] <MagicBadgers> well, here's the thing...
[03:01.11] <MagicBadgers> if it's stripped down people who would pirate the full version would more likely use the stripped down version because they can
[03:01.19] <MagicBadgers> and still offer a way for them to get money from that os
[03:01.57] <MagicBadgers> also having a free version of some kind might mean some work could be done to make it easier to just plain copy over that partition to another machine and have it work
[03:02.00] <MagicBadgers> lol
[03:02.34] <MagicBadgers> windows has always done some strange things locking it to the hardware

[12:20.01] <puddle> In the 2D projectile motion problem, you are given all but two of a=<0,−g,0>, the magnitude of v_0, θ, the initial position vector r_0, the target position r_f, t_0, and t_f. As missing information, components count individually. To find the two unknowns, 1) Derive the formula for r(t) as a coordinatewise integral IVP. Solve the system r(t_f)=r_f by
[12:20.02] <puddle> substitution."
[12:20.04] <puddle> Does this sound right?

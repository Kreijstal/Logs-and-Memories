[07:51.34] <Kido12345> Hot air balloon has hot air with density of 0.8kg/m3 and volume of 1500 m3.Its mass is (without including the air) 420 kg.If the density of air is 1.3 kg/m3 find the force required to life the balloon.
[07:51.49] <Kido12345> Oh and no Ideal law please
[07:52.02] <SpeedEvil> So wat's te problem?
[07:52.23] <SpeedEvil> work out the mass of thedisplaced air
[07:52.53] <SpeedEvil> Work out the mass of the displacing air
[07:52.55] <SpeedEvil> subtract
[07:53.20] <Kido12345> so um gV(d(air) - d(hot air)) + F = mg

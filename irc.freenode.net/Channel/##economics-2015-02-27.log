[07:21.41] <gde33|2> could anything be done about planned obsolescence?
[07:22.14] * bozzy (~boz@81.145.47.150) has joined channel ##economics
[07:22.39] <gde33|2> it is starting to take quite radical forms nowadays
[07:24.22] <gde33|2> some examples, my mum replaced her perfectly working 100 year old bicycle with a brand new one that started to fall apart in less than 6 months, after 2 years it is just a pile of rust, it badly needs to be thrown away
[07:24.53] * boz (~boz@unaffiliated/boz) Quit (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[07:26.54] <gde33|2> I buy a new washing machine 2 years ago, it started to corode in 2 months, today it finally died, if I look at second hand models I see machines from the 80's that are quite new looking, I've seen people use those for 20-30 years without much of any decay, it would need a new pump after 15 years or some other part, nothing major like turning into a giant ball of rust.
[07:29.44] <gde33|2> I should take pictures of it, it looks quite hilarious my effort towards trying to scrape off the corosion and painting it again and again.
[07:31.26] <gde33|2> Normally I would remove the store stickers from what I buy but this thing looked so horrid so quickly I never bothered, the paper sticker is in mint condition.
[07:34.37] <gde33|2> I imagine if we have economic slow down or a crisis the planned obsolescence could hit hard.

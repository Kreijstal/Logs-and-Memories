[04:47.59] <cluelessperson> I have a site here I'm trying to authenticate on and it seems the VIEWSTATE is somehow changing AFTER the page is loaded.
[04:48.07] <dtscode> people still use asp.net?
[04:48.12] <cluelessperson> I haven't found any javascript that would do it (at least not yet)
[04:48.18] <cluelessperson> dtscode, aspx?
[04:48.20] <dtscode> are you using vb for the cgi?
[04:48.54] <cluelessperson> dtscode, no, I'm not familiar, I mainly do PHP, css and python
[04:49.04] <dtscode> i was mostly kidding
[04:49.24] <cluelessperson> dtscode, id="__VIEWSTATE" value="aojph  is the original downloaded document according to Fiddler,
[04:49.32] <dtscode> i cant help
[04:49.35] <cluelessperson> dtscode, value="GHdtLOm  is what's actually on the page when I view it now.
[04:49.38] <dtscode> i never used asp.net
[04:49.43] <Madmallard> Good
[04:49.44] <cluelessperson> dtscode, and yes, this company DOES use VB. >.>
[04:49.48] <Madmallard> Lol

[04:51.23] <dtscode> i personally dont like ides
[04:51.28] <Madmallard> Y not
[04:51.31] <dtscode> cluelessperson, there are too many things wrong with this
[04:51.32] <Madmallard> Thats silly
[04:51.35] <dtscode> no its not
[04:51.46] <cluelessperson> dtscode, I shit you not.
[04:51.52] <Madmallard> Its way more work than necessary for your brain
[04:52.02] <Madmallard> Thats only gonna get easier as time goes on
[04:52.11] <cluelessperson> dtscode, We have multiple people/managers wasting their time trying to generate their own reports seperately.
[04:52.11] <Madmallard> Lol
[04:52.14] <dtscode> it always got in my way...'
[04:52.25] <Madmallard> Then u needa learn how to tame uride
[04:52.26] <dtscode> it doesnt make everyones life easier...
[04:52.29] <Madmallard> Ur ide*

[04:52.32] <Madmallard> Lol
[04:52.39] * memcpy (~memcpy@unaffiliated/memcpy) has joined channel ##programming
[04:52.42] <dtscode> or i could just use tools seperately?
[04:52.48] <dtscode> because its not really that hard?
[04:52.48] <Madmallard> I knew 1 guy at amazon that didnt use an ide other than vim
[04:52.54] <Madmallard> And he was 42
[04:52.56] <dtscode> vim's not an ide
[04:52.59] <jkbbwr> Howdy all
[04:53.04] <dtscode> and also ok. your point?
[04:53.06] <Madmallard> It has some power to it
[04:53.08] * admg (~admg@host86-139-68-128.range86-139.btcentralplus.com) has joined channel ##programming
[04:53.13] <dtscode> yes. not an ide though
[04:53.16] * i56yards (~i56yards@90.222.41.147) has joined channel ##programming
[04:53.32] <ams> ofcourse vim is an ide.
[04:53.41] <jkbbwr> ams: no its not
[04:53.42] <dtscode> not really
[04:53.52] <ams> yes, yes, really.  so is emacs.
[04:53.56] <jkbbwr> ams: no they arn't
[04:54.04] <ams> and you define this based on what?
[04:54.09] <ams> emacs was the first ide infact
[04:54.15] * PhearTheCeal (~PhearTheC@unaffiliated/pheartheceal) has joined channel ##programming
[04:54.17] <dtscode> ams, based on the fact that they are editors?
[04:54.21] <jkbbwr> The definition of ide
[04:54.24] <dtscode> actually, emacs is an os
[04:54.24] <Madmallard> code completion, syntax highlighting, findbugs, threadsafe, autoformatting
[04:54.27] <jkbbwr> An IDE normally consists of a source code editor, build automation tools and a debugger.
[04:54.36] <ams> so, like emacs.
[04:54.37] <jkbbwr> It fails on two and three
[04:54.37] <ams> interesting.
[04:54.41] <eco_work_giko> more like vim
[04:54.42] <Madmallard> These things drastically reduce the time spent doing useless things
[04:54.44] * sbrg (~identity@unaffiliated/identity) has joined channel ##programming
[04:54.53] <ams> i have source code editors, i have build automation tools, and i have a debugger (several infact)
[04:54.56] <dtscode> Madmallard, yah... i can still do that without an ide...
[04:55.17] <Madmallard> Wat
[04:55.20] <jkbbwr> ams: Using plugins or shelling out
[04:55.23] * Filystyn (~piotr@031011212161.warszawa.vectranet.pl) Quit (Read error: No route to host)
[04:55.28] <jkbbwr> ams: those features are not native to vim
[04:55.31] <ams> jkbbwr: so the emacs debugger is shelling out?
[04:55.33] <Madmallard> Code completion and autoformatting?
[04:55.38] <ams> jkbbwr: how about the slime debugger?
[04:55.40] * Litt (~M@202-89-151-114.ue.woosh.co.nz) Quit (Quit: Bah!)
[04:55.46] <ams> jkbbwr: it isn't like eclispe doesn't shell out to gdb ...
[04:55.47] <jkbbwr> ams: I don't know what slime is
[04:55.56] <ams> jkbbwr: a integreated editor for common lisp.
[04:55.57] <dtscode> neither is exclusive to an ide Madmallard
[04:56.07] * Filystyn (~piotr@031011212161.warszawa.vectranet.pl) has joined channel ##programming
[04:56.09] <dtscode> and why would i want code completetion?
[04:56.16] * vivekananda (~vvikramjh@pool-108-40-30-134.bltmmd.fios.verizon.net) Quit (Quit: Leaving)
[04:56.16] <eco_work_giko> An IDE is an editor with lots of plugins.
[04:56.16] * George__ (~George__@c-24-130-139-81.hsd1.ca.comcast.net) Quit (Remote host closed the connection)
[04:56.24] <dtscode> i know what i want to write. it saves pointless microseconds
[04:56.24] <ams> :-)
[04:56.35] <jkbbwr> ams: I don't know anything about emacs, but I know vim is not an ide
[04:56.47] <ams> jkbbwr: i consider it an ide, having used it myself for some time.
[04:56.52] <nitrxgen> :o
[04:57.08] <viscera> ams: it is, it's just DIY integration :)
[04:57.13] <ams> jkbbwr: most "ide" dont even have build automation tools
[04:57.29] <jkbbwr> ams: vim needs lots of plugins to get close to useful as my ide is
[04:57.53] <viscera> jkbbwr: which ide
[04:57.57] <bebna> and what is with c.vim ?
[04:58.04] <aidanh> apoplexy: Sorry if you messaged me and I didn't see it; had to dash out
[04:58.10] <ams> jkbbwr: so you prefer one over the other, that is fine.
[04:58.11] * jrahmy (~jrahmy@173.192.187.137-static.reverse.softlayer.com) Quit (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[04:58.20] <jkbbwr> viscera: specifically the intellij-family
[04:58.21] <apoplexy> aidanh: been writing content lol
[04:58.23] <bebna> This plugin makes vim expicitly a C ide
[04:58.36] <apoplexy> 6am now, sleep time
[04:58.48] <apoplexy> til 11, then work til 8, more content and gym
[04:58.48] * thevishy (~thevishy@111.93.187.34) has joined channel ##programming
[04:58.51] <apoplexy> its a hustlers world ;o
[04:59.25] <vendu> good morning :)
[04:59.42] <eco_work_giko> If you know vim bindings you can never have to learn another control scheme, ever, there are plugins for that on everything that supports typing (not typewriters).
[04:59.46] <Madmallard> If ur so ham to get all 5 of those perks without an ide then more power to ya i guess
[05:00.10] <vendu> eco_work_giko, vim is for weenies :P
[05:00.13] <eco_work_giko> You can use it as an IDE through ssh too.
[05:00.15] <vendu> emacs is a hog
[05:00.20] <aidanh> bebna: I can't see much that that plugin does that shouldn't be separated into individual plugins
[05:00.21] <vendu> therefore, i feel like doing my own editor :)
[05:00.31] <eco_work_giko> vendu: :(
[05:00.39] <bebna> OK, lets see intellij got: intelligent code completion, build/debug, scm, file explore, console
[05:00.42] * Belxjander (~Belxjande@sourcemage/Mage/Abh-Elementalist) Quit (Read error: No route to host)
[05:00.43] <vendu> eco_work_giko, i use emacs, but it uses lots of resources :)
[05:00.45] <aidanh> vendu: As long as it has a vi mode :P
[05:00.50] <sbrg> dtscode: asp.net != asp
[05:00.54] <bebna> do i miss something
[05:00.54] <sbrg> asp.net is not comparable to vb
[05:00.55] <dtscode> sbrg, i know
[05:01.00] <vendu> aidanh, that's one idea i'd like too, for the people who need it :)
[05:01.02] <sbrg> well, vb6
[05:01.04] <dtscode> i wasnt comparing it to vb
[05:01.07] <eco_work_giko> vendu: :P Vim has no problems.
[05:01.18] <vendu> eco_work_giko, i know, i do have problems with it, though =)
[05:01.28] <vendu> could be that i never learnt to use it properly :P
[05:01.31] <aidanh> eco_work_giko: I love vim, but saying it has no problems is far from the truth :P IMO anyway
[05:01.41] <eco_work_giko> aidanh: I was being elitist :)
[05:01.46] * Belxjander (~Belxjande@sourcemage/Mage/Abh-Elementalist) has joined channel ##programming
[05:01.56] <vendu> aidanh, eco_work_giko, first and foremost, i need good support for c (and hopefully assembly)
[05:02.02] <eco_work_giko> aidanh: But it does have problems. I think that neovim will purge lots of them tho.
[05:02.04] <vendu> auto-indent, syntax highlights, etc. :)
[05:02.13] <dtscode> neovim?
[05:02.17] <dtscode> a new fork?
[05:02.24] <sbrg> vendu: vim has those
[05:02.31] <bebna> vendu: do you already have a vim config?
[05:02.32] <vendu> sbrg, so does emacs :)
[05:02.35] <Madmallard> Lets be real though
[05:02.37] <eco_work_giko> dtscode: You are in for a treat :) ＋＋https://github.com/neovim/neovim，， .
[05:02.38] <sbrg> yeah, but emacs is emacs
[05:02.42] <vendu> bebna, nah, i'm an emacs guy :)
[05:02.44] <sbrg> so that's bad
[05:02.46] <dtscode> oh boy
[05:03.02] <Madmallard> Notepad is prolly better than eclipse for large projects with lots of dependencies heheheheh
[05:03.09] <bebna> vendu: no problems man, we have both frontiers here in the office
[05:03.11] <vendu> i do, however, have an early c tokeniser i could probably easily use for the syntax highlights :)
[05:03.33] <aidanh> eco_work_giko: Ah :) Yeah, neovim looks like it's on the right course
[05:03.40] <bebna> vendu: try to get clang-analyze / clang based autocomplete and ctags
[05:03.50] <dtscode> i should install clang...
[05:03.57] <dtscode> but i know ill just keep using gcc anyways
[05:03.58] <vendu> bebna, good ideas :)
[05:04.07] <aidanh> dtscode: I use clang just for the static analysis
[05:04.09] <icetooth> found out today vim has built in fuzzy completion if you hit ctrl-n / ctrl-p in insert mode
[05:04.16] * Sarah1994 (~Sarah@ip-80-113-19-100.ip.prioritytelecom.net) has joined channel ##programming
[05:04.22] <dtscode> clang has the sexiest error codes...
[05:04.56] <bebna> vendu: it is one of the basics of modern vim setups for programming
[05:05.13] * mvaenskae (~mvaenskae@unaffiliated/mvaenskae) Quit (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[05:05.16] <bebna> vendu: I do even have ctags for markdown and asciidoc and their like
[05:05.17] <vendu> bebna, :)
[05:05.28] <dearhawk> wow... just wow. Guys. Pretend to be a cute girl and you'll get a mod on any service to do anything. Seriously. Fact: he ain't getting laid and I just unsubscribed about 150k of his readers. Just wow.. humanity, really, seriously? Guys? You guys.. really, humanity?
[05:05.35] <vendu> bebna, what's ctags, though, what is it like? not familiar
[05:05.54] <Madmallard> Dearhawk people are lonely
[05:06.09] <Madmallard> Its symptom of societal breakdown
[05:06.49] <icetooth> a mod?
[05:06.51] <bebna> vendu: Programm who "tokenizes" code, so that other programms like vim or emacs can build trees and understand the code better
[05:06.57] <Plastefuchs> dearhawk: whowhat?
[05:06.58] * TheBigDeal (~quassel@unaffiliated/innocent99) has joined channel ##programming

[05:07.51] <dearhawk> Plastefuchs: so I pretended to be this young cute girl on twitch to milk money out of people. Easily convinced another channel guy to make me a mod in his channel. The pwnage was then real.
[05:07.52] <aidanh> vendu: I use ctags with vim; lets me jump to a definition within a project
[05:07.54] <vendu> ＋＋https://github.com/vendu/OS-Zero/blob/master/usr/tools/zed/IDEAS，， <- there's just some quick ideas :)

[05:08.23] <Plastefuchs> dearhawk: so you where an asshole just for the lulz
[05:08.43] <dearhawk> Plastefuchs: well, yes. I'm not proud of it. But the stupidity just amazed me.
[05:08.49] <bebna> vendu: some autocompleters also use it to know when a variable is only present in your current scope
[05:09.05] <Plastefuchs> dearhawk: you seem awfully proud if you prance about and talk about it to other people
[05:09.31] <eco_work_giko> Sarah1994: Sup? :)

[05:33.12] <pulse> ok there are some genuinely nice people out there
[05:33.14] <pulse> who would have thought
[05:33.33] <pulse> i ordered 3 things from the same seller on ebay, and paid for the shipping for each separately

[05:33.50] <pulse> wow.
[05:33.54] <Madmallard> Neat

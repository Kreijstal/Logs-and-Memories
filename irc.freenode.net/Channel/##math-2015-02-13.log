[11:14.10] <Pluto> MotivicScones Hi. Why there are some proofs that are not computations ? Can you elaborate and tell me more about the kinds of proofs that are not computations ? How can we tell them apart ?
[11:14.45] <wagonboi> is it valid if I split integral (sinx - cosx) to -cosx from pi/2 to 0 MINUS sinx evaulated from pi/2 to 0
[11:14.48] <Rainb> proofs that are not computed?
[11:15.00] <Rainb> like those who stem from logic and definition

[11:15.30] <Pluto> dunno has sth to do with intuitionstic logic

[11:54.14] <drazak> Pluto: for instance, the proof of the existence of non-algebraic numbers is non-costructive, and doesn't involve a real calculation
[11:54.27] <drazak> you could maybe call the cardinal logic a calculation? I dunno
[11:55.57] <tac_> drazak: I'm not sure about that
[11:56.05] <tac_> pi is constructively non-algebraic, isn't it?

[11:56.56] <drazak> tac_: yes, but the traditional proof from, say, rudin (excercise 11 in chapter 1 I think? maybe chapter 2?) is non-constructive and does not involve a calculation
[11:57.10] <tac_> is it now
[11:57.28] <tac_> How does it fail to be constructive?
[11:57.42] * Kingsquee (~kingsley@d154-20-148-78.bchsia.telus.net) Quit (Remote host closed the connection)
[11:57.45] <drazak> not of pi, of the existence of non-algebraic numbers
[11:58.12] <tac_> I mean what fails to be constructive about it
[11:58.14] <tac_> the proof
[11:58.31] <drazak> there is no non-algebraic witness
[11:58.37] <drazak> your argument is all cardinality
[11:59.10] <drazak> using that since the coefficients are integers you only have countably many possible algebraic numbers
[11:59.18] <tac_> ah
[11:59.22] <drazak> and since the reals are uncountable there must exist numbers that are not-algebraic
[11:59.38] * Romin (~Romin@97-88-251-202.static.mdsn.wi.charter.com) has joined channel ##math
[11:59.42] <tac_> Yes, that mere cardinality argument isn't constructive
[11:59.53] <drazak> yes

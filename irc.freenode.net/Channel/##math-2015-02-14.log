Session Ident: ##math
[12:00.09] <tac_> but we know that pi and e are transcendental. I am pretty sure they just require you to do enough integrals to prove they are witnesses
[12:00.18] <drazak> hmm
[12:00.22] <drazak> I think they require more
[12:00.28] <drazak> but I could be wrong

[12:57.19] <copycat> the meaning of the word "closed" is lost on me
[12:57.23] <copycat> could anyone give me a clue?
[12:58.04] <drazak> It means that the result of the operation is in the subset

[01:04.17] * duckrabbit (~duckrabbi@128.54.182.252) Quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[01:04.34] <tac_> If you know a abelian group H's isomorphism class and you know another ab group G has it as a subgroup, and you know the iso class of the quotient G/H, you know the group G, right?
[01:04.34] <lavender> your first examples of lattices are the integers in ℝ¹ and points with integer coordinates in ℝ²
[01:05.54] <lavender> so, you have the short exact sequence 0 → H → G → G/H → 0, and you know that G is the direct product H × G/H
[01:06.08] <lavender> and you know what H and G/H are
[01:06.21] * jailbot (~textual@c-73-44-196-102.hsd1.il.comcast.net) has joined channel ##math

[01:06.24] * a3Dman (~3Dman@unaffiliated/a3dman) Quit (Ping timeout: 276 seconds)
[01:06.27] <tac_> but that's a nice answer :)
[01:07.37] <tac_> I saw a question on a practice math GRE exam: If G is an abelian group of order 16 and it has an element x with x + x + x + x = 0, then what are the possibilities for what G could be?
[01:07.42] <wz1000> Would there be anyway to construct the powerset of an infinite set such that every element of the powerset that is finite can be indexed?
[01:07.46] <copycat> "the set of all (u, v) where u and v are ratios are p/q of integers
[01:08.09] <tac_> So I'm thinking it would just be the two possibilities: C4 x C4 and C4 x Z2 x Z2

[01:17.42] <asiansnowden> QUESTION: DOES   -(p⊃q) =(-p⊃- q)? Prefer to use 18 rules of Sentential Logic.
[01:18.02] <asiansnowden> I should be able to figure out the rest.

[01:19.58] <metatropolis> hee
[01:20.06] <wikiemol> but the answer to your question is yes. (If I am reading it right)
[01:20.13] <wikiemol> Its kind of garbled on my computer
[01:20.18] <monoprotic> he left, too gay for him i guess
[01:20.25] <wikiemol> lol
[01:20.36] <tac_> lol wat
[01:20.42] <tac_> @asiansnowden

[02:31.54] <DarkBloodWolf> does nyone want to play a .exe game that has it on it, or just tell you guys?
[02:31.55] <Pluto> they are not proofs
[02:31.56] <DarkBloodWolf> anyone *
[02:31.58] <Sweet_Ride> monoprotic so basically because you can't invert the division using multiplication, then division by zero for all real numbers is definitely and permanently undefined?

[02:39.25] <raskol> it's all math
[02:39.42] <raskol> if you are doing it to establish a general fact about something, call it a theorem and the math you do is a proof
[02:39.45] <lavender> whats the difference between computing something and proving that the result of the computation is something
[02:40.05] <Pluto> yes thats my doubt lavando
[02:40.12] <Pluto> but i'm talking about proof in the formal sense
[02:40.15] <tommah> you could argue that, formally, there is no difference but its not something mathematicians think about/care about too much
[02:40.17] <Pluto> as defined in math logic
[02:40.20] <Pluto> a formal proof
[02:40.35] <Pluto> as a sequence of wff formulas of first order logic ( for classical math )
[02:40.40] <Pluto> and the last formula is the theorem
[02:40.50] <toastyde1th> i tend to think of computation as determining a specific object that fufills some condition rather
[02:40.51] <tommah> if that was your definition of a proof then no mathematician proves things ;)
[02:41.08] <tommah> unless you add the condition "can be converted into a wff blablabla"
[02:41.22] <Pluto> tommah but every correct proof in informal mathematics can be converted to a formal proof
[02:41.27] <Pluto> if the required work is put
[02:41.38] <Pluto> its just a matter of time
[02:41.58] <tommah> yea but not everyone agress what constitutes a "correct proof" -- some ppl deny the ability to do proof by contradiction and others deny the axiom of choice
[02:42.06] <Pluto> the point for formalizing a proof is the same point for formalizing computation, algorithm, information
[02:42.16] <Pluto> it makes everything precise

[02:43.02] <tommah> tho you can just have different systems for different assumptions so its all good
[02:43.29] <tommah> if you wanna get real precise you can study reverse mathematics which attempts to find the minimal assumptions a given theorem requires to be proven
[02:43.36] <Pluto> every computation is then a proof,  some proofs uses computation and others don't use computation at all
[02:44.09] <Pluto> computation defined as something expressible in at least turing complete models of computation
[02:45.05] <Pluto> i mean every computation in math is then a proof in math ( possibly converted to a formal proof ), some proofs in math uses mathematical computation and others dont
[02:45.43] <DarkBloodWolf> guys: what do you think the answer is?

[02:52.52] <monoprotic> is an eaten sausage a "overall" sausage?
[02:52.53] <toastyde1th> if more than one different solution exists for a problem, that problem is easier
[02:53.03] <Pluto> DarkBloodWolf HARD question you mean
[02:53.06] <monoprotic> what is the sausage scope?
[02:53.21] <toastyde1th> because if i say "15" that fits an interpretation of the question

[02:53.34] <raskol> what about sausages that could theoretically be made out of the people eating the sausages

[06:59.38] <drazak> rank nullity?
[06:59.53] <lyxia> so dim(Im(F)) = 3, you have a set of 3 vectors that span Im(F), therefore it's a basis

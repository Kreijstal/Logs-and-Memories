[01:12.12] <kzisme> Can someone explain how variable scope works in Java compared to C++?
[01:12.30] * fangs124 is now known as fangs124_afk
[01:13.27] <Rounin> Is there a difference? Java doesn't have the global scope, obviously, since there's no global anything
[01:14.05] <mabino-pyon> kzisme: "how variable scope works in Java compared to C++" --> Exactly the same way.
[01:14.11] <mabino-pyon> kzisme: Both are lexically scoped languages.
[01:14.31] <mabino-pyon> kzisme: Errr... I phrased that badly: both languages have lexically scoped variables.
[01:14.59] <kzisme> mabino-pyon: I'm just learning Java and I haven't done much with objects just yet and I'm just making sure my variables in different control flows aren't being changed

[01:17.29] <mabino-pyon> kzisme: From the point of view of the interaction between objects and lexical scope, the main difference between Java and C++ is that C++ has lexically scoped objects, but Java only has lexically scoped references to objects. This is because objects are not first-class values in Java, only references are
[01:17.47] * WizJin (~WizJinAFK@103.21.160.239) has joined channel ##programming
[01:18.43] <kzisme> mabino-pyon: Thanks for the answer :D  I like Java a lot more than C++ thus far....or maybe it's the projects I've been assigned were far less irritating
[01:18.59] <kzisme> Also you can use HTML in Java?  I just found that out
[01:19.07] <mabino-pyon> HTML?
[01:19.14] <mabino-pyon> You mean XML?

[02:16.14] <RedmondFaires> Hi.
[02:16.31] <RedmondFaires> Guys I think there's something interesting about AI.
[02:16.47] <RedmondFaires> Imagine a hypothetical robot that was able to perfectly assume the form of a living thing
[02:16.59] <RedmondFaires> If you had enough of these robots, and they were convincing enough
[02:17.26] <RedmondFaires> You could have them perform an action. The living things which would be fooled would then join in on this action as a "swarm" collective effect

[02:25.58] <Guest66212> you could lure a shark to where humans were, etc

[02:26.19] <RedmondFaires> Hehe, maybe. :D
[02:26.40] <Guest66212> RedmondFaires: but does this observation not also apply to real fish?
[02:27.01] <RedmondFaires> Yes. It applies.
[02:27.22] <RedmondFaires> Or at least, I'd love to be able to test it.
[02:27.27] <RedmondFaires> Instead of assuming things
[02:27.55] <Guest66212> so in other words being able to exert an influence on one's environment can cause it to change in a way which is predictable and/or unpredictable
[02:27.59] <RedmondFaires> Being able to program nature. I think Google did something similar but the birds attacked their fake robot.
[02:28.10] <RedmondFaires> It was far from realistic though

[02:30.22] <RedmondFaires> I mean this has valid uses even in the field of politics.
[02:31.15] <RedmondFaires> Why don't you believe so Guest66212? It's a discovery that suggests that living things are all programmable, if they act in groups.
[02:31.26] <DrMon> If I'm debugging/reversing a program, there are stack variables between the two functions. Are these variables initalised at all, or are they all garbage before the new function touches them?
[02:31.29] <Guest66212> RedmondFaires: because there is more than one controller

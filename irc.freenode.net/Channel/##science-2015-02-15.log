[06:13.21] <Nothing-> Media being media.
[06:16.58] <Psychedelia> then there is no Hawking radiation
[06:17.04] <Psychedelia> and black holes don't evaporate.

[06:24.07] <Psychedelia> <toastydeath> because I have no illusions of being fair or just, you're now banned!
[06:24.11] <Nothing-> well dealings with the physics channel are beyond the topic here.

[11:22.39] <peachespearsoran> I'm taking a course online. can someone help me with a question about alkenes nomenclature?  Why is it when naming things with two double bonds, is it "cyclopentadiene" and not "dicyclopentene"?
[11:23.05] <peachespearsoran> why add the "a" to the pent
[11:23.52] <astroo-> give 15 minutes for a possible answer from someone

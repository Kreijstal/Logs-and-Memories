[12:18.25] <Xionaba> never ever read physics in school just started with elementary level physics. the math explained by the physics class is extremely bad compared to just pure math classes

[12:19.32] <Slereah> That's because you are reading elementary physics.
[12:19.39] <Slereah> You can do physics with pure math
[12:19.52] <Slereah> It's just not that useful at an elementary level

[12:29.54] <nebbia>  hi everyone, can sombody please explain me the physical meaning of the phase of the wavefunction ?
[12:31.05] <Slereah> Depends
[12:31.36] <Slereah> a wavefunction by itself doesn't care for the phase, because the probability gets rid of it
[12:31.54] <Slereah> But you can get interferences of phases from a basis for instance
[12:32.25] <nebbia> ok but since it doesn't play  a role, who cares about interference ?
[12:32.33] <nebbia> can you please be more precise

[12:43.32] <shminux> nebbia, what matters is that wave function/amplitude is a complex number, not the phase specifically

[12:59.31] <Astr0> Hi\
[01:01.09] <Astr0> I have a question. When you boil water to 100degrees, you need a certain amount of energy E. Now, when it's at 100degrees, another energy E_2 is needed to make the water to gas form from liquid form. What does this mean? Does this mean that water can't get hotter than 100 degrees and the rest of the energy added once it's 100 degrees will go to make water
[01:01.10] <Astr0> gas?

[05:23.18] <sorressean> A dog covers A dog covers the distance between two points, which are 7 m apart. The time it takes from point a to point b is 7 seconds. It's speed as it passes through the second point is 15.0 m/s. What is it's speed as it passes through the first point? to get this I needed to figure out the accellleration (which is constant): 15 = 7+a*7 = 8=a*7;a=8/7. I'm confused how I get the first speed through t
[05:23.24] <sorressean> he point though.

[09:10.16] <demophobia> for example, one might also use x(t) if teaching students in one dimension
[09:10.38] <linux_dream> \vec {r} (t) is more like the position in function of time

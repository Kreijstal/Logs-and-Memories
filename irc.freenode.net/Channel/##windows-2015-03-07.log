[02:24.07] <aca20031> installed any services lately (or when the BSODs started)?
[02:24.38] * thumpba (~thumpba@99-180-68-233.lightspeed.irvnca.sbcglobal.net) Quit (Remote host closed the connection)
[02:24.56] <vaba> i think no

[02:27.37] <aca20031> frankly its not that helpful, something corrupted a data structure and a service caught it and bugchecked.  Finding that something would be hard - you could check to see what preocesses are running during the dump (window > processes and threads) and check eventvwr for any errors to but probably they dont know they corrupted it and wont have logged an error
[02:27.55] <vaba> aca20031, just double checked my recently installed programs - i have not installed anything in the last month
[02:27.55] <aca20031> tracking it down would take a decicated developer :)
[02:28.25] <aca20031> you could search for those buckets online and see if anyone has any thoughts - someone suggested doing a windows upgrade to repair

[02:30.35] <allstarsnorks2> Hey there. Just asking. Will I get the final build of Windows 10 if I am on TP?
[02:31.12] <CaptObvious> no
[02:31.22] <aca20031> wouldnt trust the windows upgrade system even if you do
[02:31.24] * sleap64 (~sleap64@97e4c216.skybroadband.com) has joined channel ##windows
[02:31.35] <CaptObvious> aca20031 - I upgraded from 8.1 to the TP and it went flawlessly
[02:31.36] <CaptObvious> I was shocked
[02:31.41] <aca20031> lol
[02:31.54] <CaptObvious> had it on a USB stick just in case, tried the upgrade
[02:32.00] <CaptObvious> took about 20 mins and I was in win10 with everything there
[02:32.12] <aca20031> at the very least i bet its kept useless registry entries or SxS directories

[02:32.54] * Defunk (defunk@telnetd.org) Quit (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
[02:33.21] <vaba> aca20031, are my bsods related to ndis.sys (something related with network)?
[02:33.22] <aca20031> back to my "default credentials" question; I entered: server *.corp.domain.com, DOMAIN\user as user, and password into credential manager (under windows credentials)

[02:33.34] <aca20031> but when I connect to \\foo where foo is foo.corp.domain.com (DNS) it prompts me

[02:33.56] <aca20031> vaba I see no sign of that from that dump
[02:34.22] <aca20031> mm
[02:34.24] <aca20031> well thats notr tue
[02:34.31] <aca20031> MODULE_NAME: NETIO
[02:34.37] <aca20031> seems networky to me
[02:34.45] * lkjh1 (~lkjh@178.62.38.128) Quit (Quit: leaving)
[02:35.04] <vaba> there was: "Probably caused by : ndis.sys ( ndis+2fa29 )"
[02:35.45] <aca20031> ndis!ndisNsiGetInterfaceInformation
[02:35.49] <aca20031> that is on the stack
[02:36.19] <vaba> i am not sure if that is coincidence or not, but i am getting bsods when i am surfing on Chrome
[02:36.42] <aca20031> does view > processes and threads show anyhing or is this a mini dump

[02:37.56] <aca20031> pretty useless eh
[02:38.30] <aca20031> I guess you could try reinstalling your network drivers but thats a shot in the dark
[02:39.53] <vaba> i guess i will have to reinstall windows :/
[02:40.14] * lkjh0 (~lkjh@178.62.38.128) has joined channel ##windows
[02:40.17] <aca20031> might as well follow  that boring l ink from above first

[02:40.43] <vaba> i saw that
[02:41.16] <vaba> in my case it is 2 -> 2

[02:42.13] <aca20031> sure it is
[02:42.44] <aca20031> we know why there was a fault - if you were a developer getting this in your program you could probably track it down
[02:42.59] <aca20031> but since youre not, and you dont know for sure what program causes it...yeah kind of meh

[02:43.47] <aca20031> interesting. I entered foo.corp.domain.com into the credential manager (instead of *)
[02:44.01] <aca20031> now when I go anywhere I get "An extended error has occured"

[02:21.46] <SailorR> does time flow at a uniform rate?
[02:22.13] <SailorR> (guess im asking if its rate of change is constant or not)
[02:24.11] <mortdeus> SailorR,  Time is diluted by motion.
[02:24.20] <mortdeus> dilated*
[02:24.28] <egg> SailorR: rate of change with respect to ...?
[02:24.59] * fireballs (~fireballs@128.135.100.109) has joined channel ##physics
[02:25.00] <SailorR> egg: I guess im trying to figure that out ...I suppose I need some meta-time
[02:25.06] <SailorR> or to look at it like a scalar field
[02:25.35] <egg> there's no meta-time in physics. but there are different times measured by clocks in different states of motion.
[02:25.48] <egg> (and different places)

[02:26.25] <SailorR> egg so could we take the derivative wrt to motion
[02:26.36] <egg> motion is not a quantity
[02:27.01] <SailorR> its a vector though isnt it?
[02:27.03] <egg> special and general relativity describes what happens when we compare different clocks
[02:27.04] <SailorR> maybe a vector derivative

[02:28.14] <shminux> SailorR, since rate is measured with respect to time, the rate of flow of time is always 1...
[02:28.22] * pnint2 (pnint2@unaffiliated/pnint) has joined channel ##physics
[02:30.12] <SailorR> ok what about if we consider the multiverse model where each universe has different times ...is there a way to compare them?
[02:30.13] <SailorR> at all
[02:30.16] <SailorR> even abstractly
[02:30.32] <mortdeus> SailorR, your notion of time is relative to your frame of reference. As matter approaches the speed of light it turns out that light is constant for all observers at rest. (in other words, not accellerating.)
[02:30.35] <egg> SailorR: comparing different clocks (even of the same construction) makes perfect sense. and it's interesting. clocks on a tower measure a different time than clocks at its base. clocks on a satellite measure different time than clocks on earth. it's experimentally confirmed.
[02:31.17] <SailorR> egg but if time is so relative then what determines what can interact with what?
[02:31.32] <SailorR> if not time
[02:31.56] <egg> ??
[02:31.56] <SailorR> even if our times are relative I can interact with you all
[02:31.56] <SailorR> why?
[02:32.05] <egg> why not
[02:32.41] <mortdeus> which brings this bizarre effect that if you were traveling 99.9% of the speed of light, from your frame of reference light still travels at 300 million meters per second as far as you and your instruments are concerned.
[02:32.55] <mortdeus> So what the hell has happened?
[02:33.30] * fireballs (~fireballs@128.135.100.109) Quit (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[02:33.41] <SailorR> egg: there must be some notion of simultaneous events (meta-time)
[02:35.08] <SailorR> if you ccan deduce event A happened prior to event B
[02:35.15] <SailorR> in that A and B cant interact
[02:35.28] <SailorR> regardless of reference frames
[02:37.23] <egg> SailorR: sorry, even the simultaneity of two events is relative :)
[02:37.32] * egg afk
[02:37.57] <SailorR> so I could interact with my parents before I was born?
[02:37.58] <SailorR> lol
[02:38.01] <SailorR> or the big bang
[02:38.17] <SailorR> or beethoven was born after me
[02:38.49] <SailorR> I agree that the simultaneity of two events might be relative as in not exact but obviously some events precede others
[02:38.53] <SailorR> its not that free
[02:38.56] <mortdeus> it turns at that as you approach the speed of light, atomic clocks are forced to slow down because they have mass and e=mc2, which is basically a way of saying that the more energy you put behind matter trying to push it to achieve the speed of a massless particle the more mass it starts to gain as energy is diverted into matter.
[02:39.23] <mortdeus> and everything regarding our notion of time is dependent on our relative notion of the speed on light here on earth.

[02:40.41] <SailorR> the only way that makes sense is if there was no cause and effect lol
[02:40.46] <SailorR> or everything was occuring simultaneously
[02:41.08] * merzo (~merzo@41-5-133-95.pool.ukrtel.net) Quit (Remote host closed the connection)
[02:41.13] <SailorR> did einstein consider the idea of cause /effect
[02:41.15] <ldunn> SailorR: you can assign an order to events which could be causally connected which is preserved in all frames of reference
[02:41.20] <SailorR> when he said events arent simultaneous
[02:41.35] <SailorR> ldunn hm
[02:41.36] <mortdeus> everything from a sun dial, to an atomic clock, to the neurons in your brains, are all dependent on the speed of light propogating through a conductive medium. And as it turns out the more mass the conductive medium gains the more energy it takes to get the clock to "tick".
[02:41.46] <ldunn> relativity of simultaneity does not mean "for any events A and B there is a frame of reference where A occurs before B, another where they are simulatenous, and another where B occurs before A"
[02:43.26] <SailorR> now im wondering if theres some absolute universal meta-time
[02:43.36] <SailorR> thats true in all referencce frames across all multiverses
[02:43.45] <SailorR> determined by cause and effect
[02:43.55] <SailorR> and if so where are we in this chain
[02:43.55] <mortdeus> ultimately it should be understood that our notion of the rate time flows is flawed and biased towards what we percieve
[02:44.06] <mortdeus> SailorR, the speed of light
[02:44.10] <ldunn> mortdeus: uh
[02:44.58] <qnt> i need to make a PI-regulator. i have that G(s) = p*t_1/(1 + s*t_1) for an open system. i have to choose the regulator parameters so that the closed system gets the relative attentuation S (symbol i can't make) and the eigenanglefrequence w, that is so that characteristic polynomial is s^2 + 2Sws + w^2. in the answer i need to express K and T_1 in p and t_1 plus w and S. can someone help me,
[02:44.58] <qnt> please? i'm stuck
[02:45.06] <ldunn> you can illustrate the dilation of time without invoking E = mc^2 :(
[02:46.09] <mortdeus> idunn, the speed of light is a key part of the lorentz transformation.
[02:46.17] <ldunn> I know that
[02:46.24] <SailorR> I think cause and effect
[02:46.24] <ldunn> I didn't say it wasn't
[02:46.29] <SailorR> is ccloser to what people perceive as time
[02:46.34] <ldunn> E = mc^2 is not the lorentz transformation
[02:46.36] <SailorR> but different than what einstein measured
[02:46.40] <SailorR> or talked about
[02:49.35] <mortdeus> ÔºãÔºãhttp://ffden-2.phys.uaf.edu/212_fall2003.web.dir/Eddie_Trochim/lorenzeq1.jpgÔºåÔºå

[02:50.31] <mortdeus> note that in the numerator that velocity is set porportional to the speed of light.
[02:50.38] <SailorR> wat
[02:50.47] <SailorR> those equatons arent true for v=c
[02:50.48] <SailorR> so
[02:50.52] <SailorR> how does einstien conclude anything
[02:50.56] <SailorR> about what happens when v=c
[02:50.56] <SailorR> lol
[02:51.04] <mortdeus> SailorR, Thats the point.....
[02:51.24] <mrdata> v approaches c but never gets there
[02:51.26] <SailorR> mortdeus no he concludes time stops and blah blah blah infinite mass etc
[02:51.28] <SailorR> but in fact
[02:51.34] <SailorR> anything could happen because equations break down lol
[02:51.38] <SailorR> maybe theres no equations for when v=c
[02:51.50] <SailorR> *new
[02:52.50] * caramel (~caramel@unaffiliated/caramel) has joined channel ##physics
[02:53.55] <mortdeus> as v approaches c, you end up in a situation where the square root of 1-v^2/c^2 becomes infinitely closer to the square root of 0. Which is impossible.
[02:54.05] <ldunn> ...
[02:54.17] <SailorR> mortdeus yea I get its a limit but
[02:54.25] <SailorR> you cant conclude aobut what actually is the truth
[02:54.28] <SailorR> at v=c from a limit lol
[02:54.43] <mortdeus> in this particular instance because that means we are going to divide by 0, and the universe only likes to do that when you are a fatass star.
[02:55.09] <mrdata> perhaps not even then
[02:56.06] * Xenolith (~Xenolith@unaffiliated/xenolith) Quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[02:56.43] <SailorR> I thought the whole problem with quantum gravity was
[02:56.46] <SailorR> the limit broke down
[02:56.49] <mortdeus> mrdata, this is where blacks holes comes from.
[02:56.51] <SailorR> I mean the equation broke down
[02:57.01] <SailorR> so no conclusions coculd be made
[02:57.14] <SailorR> why are ppl drawing cocnlusions about what happens at v=c here?
[02:57.24] <SailorR> shouldnt there be a new field of physics that investigagtes this question?
[02:57.26] <mrdata> mortdeus, the real universe tends to avoid inifinities
[02:57.26] <SailorR> like for quantum gravity

[03:05.13] <mortdeus> SailorR, the problem is that since light is constant yet it is influenced by the force of gravity; there is a scenario where a super massive star's core gains so much mass that heavier atoms than hydron start to undergo nuclear fusion which increases their mass dramatically, and gravity becomes all that more powerful, and then it fuses again, and each time the core manages to fuse into another heavier element, we push our V element faster and faster a
[03:05.13] <mortdeus> nd faster and faster until we reach a point where light has to lose because space is collapsing in on itself faster than light can propogate through space.
[03:06.58] <mortdeus> and thats where all sorts of weirdness begins to happen.

[03:20.24] <mrdata> mortdeus, i dont think the core is gaining mass; density yes, not mass
[03:21.33] <mrdata> unless stuff is falling in
[03:22.20] <mrdata> does it fall in? or is it pushed back
[03:22.32] * sbellina (~sbellina@66.29.187.48.static.utbb.net) Quit (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[03:23.50] <mrdata> and nuclesr fusion is kind of a nonsequitur
[03:23.53] <mortdeus> mrdata, E = MC2
[03:24.10] <mortdeus> or in this case E/C^2 = M
[03:24.13] <SpeedEvil> It's losing mass even - the nucleii are being converted to photons which gradually escape (and neutrinos, which escape faster)
[03:24.41] <SpeedEvil> Nuclear fusion does not increase the mass of the stellar core.
[03:24.51] <SpeedEvil> Or any part of it. It may increase the density.

[03:28.54] <mortdeus> SpeedEvil, observe that when hydrogen undergoes fusion to become helium, its molar mass goes from a total of ~2 individually to ~4 together.   ÔºãÔºãhttp://www.ptable.com/Images/periodic%20table.pngÔºåÔºå

[03:30.03] <SpeedEvil> The key is in the ~

[03:30.48] <mortdeus> mrdata, yeah and E/C^2 gives you the amount of energy it takes to become 1 unit of mass.

[09:39.14] <xihr> tidal forces near the classical singularity tear ATOMS apart long before you get into the QG realm
[09:39.16] <fahadash> mortdeus, This guy is saying that "erasing bits" from computers means "ejecting them out of computer", while erasing bits really mean is replacing them with another. A bit is just a state in flip-flop.

[09:39.30] <KAHR-Alpha> mortdeus: what happens when I'm deleting files then?
[09:40.02] <xihr> i.e., nothing he's saying there has anything to do with anything useful being inside the black hole
[09:42.35] <fahadash> KAHR-Alpha, To be precise depends on file-system. But many file systems just erase the "link" in allocation-table.
[09:43.27] <mortdeus> we would have to accept that information is never destroyed anywhere in the universe; except inside blackholes. It's enough of a ludicrous idea, that Einstein didn't believe black holes were out there, despite accepting the theoretical reality that the universe allows them to exist.
[09:43.37] <xihr> mortdeus: you're not reading
[09:44.09] <xihr> even if AdS/CFT is right (and its implications are not understood), information not being destroyed doesn't mean that the information is arranged in a useful way inside a black hole
[09:44.37] <xihr> things are smashed and ruined beyond all recognizability in a black hole, before QG effects dominate
[09:44.49] <xihr> in short, AdS/CFT or no, what you said is simply not true
[09:45.02] <KAHR-Alpha> fahadash: what about a low level formatting?
[09:45.44] <xihr> the special weirdness involving firewalls, etc. (just a guess as to how to resolve the paradox, which is just as weird as the other solutions, such as violation of conservation of information) have to do with entangled particles in Hawking radiation, not anything previously inside the black hole

[09:58.05] <xihr> no one knows the answer to that, so I don't know why you're still talking about it
[09:58.08] <mortdeus> or rather we saw toto go in and now we couldn't prove he ever existed because the matter which once constituted him is just gone.
[09:58.41] <mortdeus> the holographic principle presents a pretty damn compelling answer to where toto went.

[11:52.23] <webley> it is a thought

[11:53.40] <mortdeus> the thing is, the sun has waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaayy more gravitational influence on its satellites than we do on the objects around us.
[11:54.12] <webley> in a sense there would be relative, local 'flatness'
[11:54.21] <mortdeus> I mean it keeps pluto in orbit and thats not even the furthest planetoid out there.
[11:55.22] <webley> obviously a planet has more effect on its moon(s) than the sun alone does
[11:55.39] <mortdeus> we couldn't keep the moon in orbit if it was all the way chilling where jupiter is (and all the planets out there magically went on vaction to the pinwheel galaxy for a day to make my point valid)
[11:56.06] <webley> maybe if there was nothing else for lightyears
[11:56.13] <webley> if it really was flat
[11:56.29] <webley> then a tiny inclination might be enough
[11:56.37] <webley> for a slow long orbit period
[11:57.05] <mortdeus> so there is more to it than just to say that a big mass attracts a littler mass porportionally the same as you scale up and down.
[11:57.15] <webley> it is all those gravity bumps that get in the way
[11:57.40] <webley> it is mutual 'attraction'

[12:00.09] <mortdeus> there is a piece of the puzzle that we just don't quite understand really and thats when we consider quantum gravity.

[12:02.16] <mortdeus> webley, well we know for one that space is expanding as an exponentially increasing rate. However we also know that space is being sucked in to the super massive blackhole in the center of our galaxy.
[12:02.49] <SpeedEvil> No, we don't.
[12:02.59] <webley> and by two objects sharing the same spacetime, they free up loose space
[12:03.02] <SpeedEvil> The supermassive blackhole is fucking small.
[12:03.13] <SpeedEvil> And a basically constant diameter
[12:03.24] <SpeedEvil> Black holes do not suck in space.

[12:05.39] <mortdeus> SpeedEvil, Regardless we do know that the black hole in the middle of our galaxy is strong enough to have an influence to have every star in the milkey way orbit around it.

[12:06.37] <mortdeus> maybe not a super fast orbit but enough for us to consider that we spin because blackholes do.

[12:08.12] <SpeedEvil> The black hole at the centre of the galaxy spins because the infalling matter spun.
[12:08.13] <webley> but wrongness feels so good
[12:08.31] <SpeedEvil> It continues to spin at exactly the ame speed as it would without that black hole
[12:08.36] <webley> maybe it is the corellas effect of a spinning universe

[12:11.37] <mortdeus> SpeedEvil, of course I understand that things were spinning and orbiting around each other before the supermassive blackhole in our galaxy existed.
[12:12.02] <webley> can anyone tell me how to calculate the total curvature of spacetime for a given mass of a given density?

[12:14.33] <mortdeus> however, the uniformity of the milkey way rotating as an entire galaxy, suggests that the massive gravity at the center of our galaxy seems to spin in a way that influences everything else to start orbiting around it.

[01:06.49] <webley> are you sure it is not ego, apetiss? just asking

[01:12.26] <mortdeus> and after so many chemical reactions, some of this chemical we call life changes into compounds that can start reacting with each other in a way that they produce a much more complex and sophisticated compound, and given enough time evolution keeps pushing forward until sentient beings like humans form.

[01:19.50] <mortdeus> koollman, and when computers try to think like us they suck too. Whats your point?
[01:20.05] <koollman> mortdeus: "can think in much the same way that computers can think" -> false
[01:20.07] <apetiss> we are programmed differently
[01:20.11] <webley> computers cant touch our confusion
[01:20.51] <webley> bosons exclude bosons, but do they exclude fermions?
[01:21.03] <webley> do fermions exclude bosons?

[01:22.24] <fahadash> Can Quantum Entaglement be used to send information from one point in universe to another? Example, communication between Curiosity and Earth stations?
[01:23.19] <mortdeus> koollman, I mean that the idea of human intelligence and sentience is possible because physics permit for logic systems to exist.
[01:23.42] <koollman> I'm not sure it's a logic system
[01:24.00] <koollman> humans are rarely rational
[01:24.00] <webley> they are getting really good at peripheral, delicate sensing of things without direct observation
[01:24.33] <webley> the human brain is mostly an irrational advatage seeking device
[01:24.46] <webley> but that is probably life too.

[01:27.42] <mortdeus> and that from a physical interpretation, the difference between a human and a computer is, if you guys bare with me, is like the difference between a mac and a pc. Where a mac is a totally different platform than windows when it comes to silicon based, boolean logic derived logic system, we are just a different platform of computer when compared to digital computers when speaking in the most abstract interpretation of logic systems.

[01:28.57] <webley> computers are proceedural, humans [neurological entities] are irrational compulsive thrashers

[01:30.08] <webley> it is bosons that have exclusive occupation of space, yes?
[01:30.24] <mortdeus> that is the biological version of a CPU transistor. And here is the digital version of the neuron. ÔºãÔºãhttp://www.research.ibm.com/cognitive-computing/#fbid=erMcHPa9acPÔºåÔºå
[01:31.45] <webley> it is probably the fragmentary, broken bits of logic that lead dynamic action

[01:39.30] <wizkidsafo> Greetings, So I got this problem where I'm to calculate total displacement by adding displacements in opposite directions. Q:"If a dog leaves her trainer & runs 80m due west to pick up a ball, she then carries the ball 27m due east to a drop off point. whats the dogs total displacement" So I have the solution and it says that 27 meters due east is the same as -27m [W]... I dont understand how that can be
[01:39.32] <wizkidsafo> true.
[01:40.54] <koollman> wizkidsafo: if you walk 10m one way, then walk back to your starting point 10m, what's the displacement ?

[12:35.46] <Rainb> so, what is boinc
[01:11.40] <MiniFridge> Rainb, it is a crows-computing project
[01:12.12] <MiniFridge> You do a little part of a project. Your computer will get calculations to do from your desired project, calculate, then send it back to to the project.
[01:12.27] <MiniFridge> It distributes load for research
[01:12.41] <MiniFridge> I believe it doesn't have to be research though.
[01:13.21] <MiniFridge> BOINC can be a bit demanding on your PC though. So, you may need to modify settings to get it where you want.
[01:13.42] <MiniFridge> also, I mean't crowd in my first sentence.

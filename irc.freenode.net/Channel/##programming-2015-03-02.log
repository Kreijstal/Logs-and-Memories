[12:02.09] <rangergord> We can compromise here. Let's call those cartoons "art". Like, in quotes.
[12:02.14] <[boxed-pyon]> Lady_Aleena: Most of them are 100% about the fan service, 0% about the art.
[12:02.20] <Lady_Aleena> The only cartoons I find watchable these days is those done by Bluth.
[12:02.24] <[boxed-pyon]> (And those are precisely the ones that I like.)

[12:05.21] <Snake2k> nitrxgen: ssssssssSsssSssSSSSssss
[12:05.23] <DarkElement> Tis true
[12:05.24] <[boxed-pyon]> Snake2k: No, just boxed.
[12:05.30] <DarkElement> They didn't like python in hogwarts
[12:05.31] <Snake2k> delta-nry: THAT IS A LIE MADE BY THE MEDIA!
[12:05.37] <Snake2k> delta-nry: HE SPEAKS *pukes* JAVA!
[12:05.40] <Snake2k> delta-nry: ...
[12:05.43] <DarkElement> OH GOD
[12:05.47] <[boxed-pyon]> Snake2k: Boxed pyon has the same representation as everything else: hidden behind a pointer.
[12:05.48] <DarkElement> WHAT
[12:05.56] <delta-nry> He prefers list comprehensions over first-class functions
[12:06.05] * kggr (~korggrodn@mail.ramtex.by) has joined channel ##programming
[12:06.22] <Snake2k> [boxed-pyon]: Math wizard...
[12:06.28] <DarkElement> LOL
[12:06.29] <Snake2k> DarkElement: Yus... Potter is evil!!!
[12:06.32] <[boxed-pyon]> Snake2k: But this has nothing to do with math!

[12:06.40] * froboy (froboy@128.54.205.13) has joined channel ##programming
[12:06.41] <DarkElement> So does this mean
[12:06.47] <delta-nry> he is the Javatar
[12:06.50] <DarkElement> That Voldemort used python and was thus the good guy
[12:06.50] <Snake2k> [boxed-pyon]: The fact that you identified that makes you even more of a... Math Wizard...
[12:06.53] <Snake2k> delta-nry: Lmao hahaha
[12:06.59] <Snake2k> DarkElement: Exactly... Darn media...
[12:07.04] * Sadale (~Sadale@unaffiliated/sadale) Quit (Disconnected by services)
[12:07.05] * armyriad (~armyriad@66-214-18-26.dhcp.lnbh.ca.charter.com) Quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)

[12:07.08] * sadale_ is now known as Sadale
[12:07.10] <Snake2k> DarkElement: He was fighting for the rights of all agile wizards...
[12:07.21] <[boxed-pyon]> DarkElement: Voldemort just has bad PR.
[12:07.41] <Snake2k> [boxed-pyon]++
[12:07.42] <DarkElement> Yea true story

[12:08.38] <delta-nry> Surely you’ve all heard the story of the great battle between wizards, rock stars and ninjas
[12:08.49] <delta-nry> the gurus of course, did not partcipate
[12:08.55] <DarkElement> Ragnarok?
[12:09.01] * Lymia (~lymia@inportb/loli/cirno-chan) Quit (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[12:09.12] <[boxed-pyon]> Speaking about bad PR... A while ago, they found crockoaches in a restaurant, and instead of apologizing, the manager said it was probably something the customer deliberately did to give them bad PR. Then some "communication expert" came in and said this was "primarily a PR/communication problem".
[12:09.18] <[boxed-pyon]> s/about/of/
[12:09.34] <DarkElement> People blaming people
[12:09.38] <Snake2k> delta-nry: Nope >___>
[12:09.49] <Snake2k> DarkElement: Snakes never blame snakes... Snakes > People
[12:09.52] <Snake2k> DarkElement: Wanna join us?
[12:09.56] <Snake2k> DarkElement: One of us... One of us...
[12:09.59] <[boxed-pyon]> I mean, dafuq, how is any amount of communication make contaminated food any more edible?
[12:10.12] <DarkElement> Snake2k: I like your ideals.
[12:10.15] <[boxed-pyon]> going* to* make
[12:10.21] <DarkElement> Snake2k: How does one join the snakes?
[12:10.23] <Snake2k> [boxed-pyon]: Lmao wtf?
[12:10.50] <[boxed-pyon]> Yep, that was exactly my reaction.
[12:10.53] * justanotheruser (~Justan@unaffiliated/justanotheruser) has joined channel ##programming
[12:10.54] <[boxed-pyon]> "wtf?"
[12:11.07] * Lymia (~lymia@inportb/loli/cirno-chan) has joined channel ##programming
[12:11.09] <Snake2k> DarkElement: You just have to let me devour your soul, then Snake2k += DarkElement # Still Snake2k ... around Snake2008... Snake2k...
[12:11.11] <delta-nry> [boxed-pyon]: multiple levels of indirection leave the client hanging
[12:11.35] <DarkElement> O_O
[12:11.44] <DarkElement> Still like the python
[12:11.44] * Snake2k starts hugging DarkElement 
[12:11.47] <DarkElement> Guess it makes sense
[12:11.51] <DarkElement> NO WAIT
[12:11.55] <[boxed-pyon]> delta-nry: lol
[12:11.57] <DarkElement> Calm down there
[12:11.58] * Snake2k backs off of DarkElement 
[12:12.00] <Snake2k> >_>
[12:12.11] <DarkElement> I'm not ready to be devoured by Snake2k yet, sorry
[12:12.21] <Snake2k> DarkElement: y u do dis? i cri evryteim :'(
[12:12.26] * kermit (unknown@pdpc/supporter/bronze/kermit) Quit (Quit: Leaving.)
[12:12.30] <fugue2> you guys should be
[12:12.32] <DarkElement> lik dis if u cri evertim
[12:12.34] <fugue2> PROGRAMMING
[12:12.41] <Snake2k> fugue2: I agree :|
[12:12.43] <DarkElement> fugue2: I'm finished for the day m8
[12:12.54] <[boxed-pyon]> fugue2: No, programming is too boring.
[12:12.55] * Snake2k likz it
[12:12.59] * kermit (unknown@pdpc/supporter/bronze/kermit) has joined channel ##programming
[12:13.02] <[boxed-pyon]> fugue2: Also, too hard.
[12:13.10] * thumpba (~thumpba@38.104.231.214) has joined channel ##programming
[12:13.11] * MissionCritical (~MissionCr@unaffiliated/missioncritical) has joined channel ##programming
[12:13.32] <RustyShackleford> how does streaming video work?
[12:13.36] * pretodor (~pretodor@113.162.115.33) has joined channel ##programming
[12:13.36] <RustyShackleford> can you stream from a link to the file you want to view? or does the server have to work harder somehow, breaking the video into "chunks"
[12:13.40] <fugue2> Well then, do you remember a time when it was fun for you?
[12:13.48] <DarkElement> Snake2k, perhaps I will accept your offer one day, until then, good night friends!
[12:14.10] <Snake2k> DarkElement: Good night, young soon-to-be part of Snake2k... :}
[12:14.21] <DarkElement> ;) lol
[12:14.25] * DarkElement (~DarkEleme@108-192-150-52.lightspeed.gnvlsc.sbcglobal.net) Quit ()
[12:14.37] <fugue2> programming is the creating of universes with impunity
[12:15.10] * DolpheenDream (~DolphinDr@pool-173-75-54-132.pitbpa.fios.verizon.net) has joined channel ##programming
[12:15.16] * astropirate (~astropira@c-73-203-60-11.hsd1.co.comcast.net) has joined channel ##programming
[12:15.17] <fugue2> you must remember that, never forget that the power is within you to remake the universe as you see fit
[12:15.41] * [boxed-pyon] prefers to view programming as a logical activity, rather than storytelling and world-building (in the literary sense).
[12:15.54] * thryckz (~thryckz@pool-74-109-12-54.phlapa.fios.verizon.net) has joined channel ##programming
[12:16.58] * arescorpio (~arescorpi@76-243-16-190.fibertel.com.ar) Quit (Excess Flood)
[12:17.13] <rangergord> any of you experienced in Linux/networking? I got one Linux machine where if I connect to it remotely and issue a reboot command, I immediately get "Connection closed by remote host". On another, it takes a full minute to get that. It's actually faster to close the terminal window, open it again, and connect back, than it is to wait for detection of connection loss. What option can I set on the 2nd host to make it beha
[12:17.14] <rangergord> ve like the 1st?
[12:17.16] <sir_galahad_ad_> also i think fugue might be underestimating the shear size of the universe
[12:17.33] * thumpba (~thumpba@38.104.231.214) Quit (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[12:17.51] <fugue2> the logical activity part are the invocation of the spells you use to conjure the spirits of the computer
[12:18.10] * mike802 (~IceChat9@pool-70-109-154-113.cncdnh.east.myfairpoint.net) Quit (Quit: On the other hand, you have different fingers.)
[12:19.10] * fleshtheworld (~fleshthew@2602:306:cf0f:4da0:a99f:ad7d:40cf:1a3b) Quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[12:20.17] * ghostpl_ (~ghostpl@c203-85.icpnet.pl) has joined channel ##programming
[12:20.40] <fugue2> holy crap I killed all talkings in the channel
[12:21.00] <rangergord> RustyShackleford: you can definitely stream by file chunks, because video files tend to put the frame index at the beginning. ever opened a video off a network drive? It opens immediately, without downloading the whole file first.
[12:21.16] * tmh1999 (~tmh1999@118.70.183.54) Quit (Quit: Leaving)
[12:21.17] * allegorical (63f4e292@gateway/web/freenode/ip.99.244.226.146) has joined channel ##programming
[12:21.35] * astropirate (~astropira@c-73-203-60-11.hsd1.co.comcast.net) Quit (Changing host)
[12:21.35] * astropirate (~astropira@unaffiliated/astropirate) has joined channel ##programming
[12:21.39] <rangergord> but I also think streaming servers are a lot more sophisticated than doing basic file IO like in my example
[12:22.31] <RustyShackleford> i'm not even sure what to search. my google searches aren't giving me relevant links
[12:22.35] * jjhurt5 (~jjhurt5@184.63.31.183) has joined channel ##programming
[12:22.37] * sukeruke (~sukeruke@unaffiliated/sukeruke) has joined channel ##programming
[12:22.41] * thryckz (~thryckz@pool-74-109-12-54.phlapa.fios.verizon.net) Quit (Quit: Lost terminal)
[12:23.00] <rangergord> there's probably FOSS media servers you can look at
[12:23.04] <RustyShackleford> the idea here would be streaming to a chromecast device, which seems extremely similar to streaming to a web browswer
[12:23.33] <sukeruke> hi i am not a programmer but i would like some help
[12:23.35] <RustyShackleford> yeah if I can use something that already exists, thats less work for me to do
[12:23.38] <woggle> rangergord: I'd guess the "well-behaved" reboot is SIGTERM/KILL'ing your shell and waiting a bit before actually rebooting...
[12:23.48] <RustyShackleford> i'd also want a way to browse the media available on the server
[12:24.09] <sukeruke> i think i am victim of a man in the middle what should i do to fix this?
[12:24.22] * Litt (~M@202-89-151-114.ue.woosh.co.nz) Quit (Read error: Connection timed out)
[12:24.40] <sukeruke> cause i cant visit any major site including youtube and facebook
[12:24.48] * ghostpl_ (~ghostpl@c203-85.icpnet.pl) Quit (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[12:24.52] * Litt (~M@202-89-151-114.ue.woosh.co.nz) has joined channel ##programming
[12:25.17] * fugue2 (~fugue@gbc1124332.lnk.telstra.net) Quit (Quit: leaving)
[12:25.19] <woggle> RustyShackleford: You can just send the video file. Everything more than that is just optimizations/dealing with failures.
[12:25.59] <woggle> RustyShackleford: (Almost all video+audio formats are designed to be read in order, so...)
[12:26.34] <rangergord> RustyShackleford: seems like this is the protocol: ＋＋https://developers.google.com/cast/，，
[12:28.31] * nda_ (~nda_@68.216.16.62.customer.cdi.no) Quit (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[12:28.40] <GeneralVagueness> different video formats have different ways of arranging the data internally so ideally you'd want a protocol and format that work well together, so you're not always waiting on another packet to finish a frame or whatever
[12:29.03] * muttstuffle (~muttstuff@pool-173-72-156-137.clppva.fios.verizon.net) Quit (Quit: Exiting Program)
[12:29.39] * Anaphaxeton (~georgios@unaffiliated/anaphaxeton) has joined channel ##programming
[12:30.19] <GeneralVagueness> but then that's where variable packet sizes come in too, streaming is the major use of oversized packets IIRC
[12:30.20] * sukeruke (~sukeruke@unaffiliated/sukeruke) has left ##programming (("Leaving"))
[12:31.25] <GeneralVagueness> it still makes me smile there's official(?) documentation referring to them as jumbograms
[12:32.23] <rangergord> woggle: thanks. I don't see any differences in the init scripts...both launch telnetd in /etc/inittab, and don't mention shutdown. I'll add a "kill telnetd" there and see if that fixes it.
[12:32.51] * froboy (froboy@128.54.205.13) Quit (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[12:32.52] <woggle> You're running telnetd?????
[12:33.04] <rangergord> woggle: it's an embedded device :P
[12:33.25] <woggle> dropbear....
[12:33.46] * GeneralVagueness telnets into woggle's microwave
[12:34.35] * L8D (~L8D@99-156-81-153.lightspeed.austtx.sbcglobal.net) has joined channel ##programming
[12:34.56] <rangergord> I'll give that a shot when I got time
[12:35.01] <RustyShackleford> rangergord: yeah i've read the chromecast docs a few time. I suppose reading them again can't hurt, but i'm rather confused
[12:35.16] * amigojapan (~amigojapa@c119045.net21845.cablenet.ne.jp) has joined channel ##programming
[12:35.44] <woggle> I'm slightly surprised there's not some nice "browser-controlled-VLC-with-browser-output" hack that's obviously findable.

[12:36.29] <rangergord> speaking of VLC, what's that I heard about a holy war between VLC and ffmpeg's teams? I didn't bother looking it up

[01:18.05] <rindolf> vdamewood: ah.
[01:18.35] <zzxx> What does it mean if a project is released under GPLv3, but also has copyright notices on it? I found an open source project on github, and fixed some of the bugs in the issue tracker, but now i see that the code has (c) 2011-2014 Persons Name on it everywere
[01:18.54] <zzxx> I am keen to release my patches to the project
[01:18.56] <rangergord> zzxx: that person still owns the code, they just allow you to use if if you abide by the GPL3
[01:19.22] <zzxx> so if i send in my patches does he take ownership of my code?
[01:19.25] <rangergord> it depends on the project's contribution rules whether you retain copyright on your own patches
[01:19.29] <rangergord> read your mind
[01:19.44] <rangergord> some projects require transfer of ownership to accept your patches, other allow you to keep your copyright
[01:19.59] <zzxx> Ok gotcha
[01:20.06] <vdamewood> In general, unless there's some contract assigning then the rights, you keep them.
[01:20.53] <zzxx> The point of these rights is to permit releaseing code under other licenses in the future in addition to GPL3?

[01:21.40] * Technodrome (~heythere@unaffiliated/technodrome) has joined channel ##programming
[01:21.42] <rangergord> that, and being able to sue the people who violate the GPL agreement (ie code thiefs)
[01:22.01] <zzxx> rangergord: ok great. thanks.
[01:22.56] <rangergord> for example a single VLC developer is responsible for taking an unofficial VLC build off the iOS Appstore. Apple does not allow LGPL software (indirectly), which violates VLC's license. Although most devs didn't care, one dev who holds copyright on his own contribs to VLC, got it taken down
[01:23.55] <vdamewood> zzxx: Also note that your contribute to a project, and you keep the rights, they are now using *your* code under the GPL.
[01:24.12] * xff0x (~xff0x@86.57.158.78) has joined channel ##programming
[01:24.17] <[boxed-pyon]> Say someone submits patch Foo a patch to project Bar. Foo is MIT-licensed *to Bar's developers specifically*. Bar itself is GPL3-licensed. Aren't Bar's developers allowed to redistribute Foo under the GPL3?

[01:24.55] <rangergord> [boxed-pyon]: yeah, GPL3 projects can use MIT code
[01:25.40] <vdamewood> [boxed-pyon], what do you mean by 'to bar's developers specifically'? Is there a clause that says only bar's developers have the license, or are they just the only ones who have a copy with the MIT-license stamped on it?
[01:25.43] * ghostpl_ (~ghostpl@c203-85.icpnet.pl) Quit (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[01:26.09] <rangergord> but that part of the code wouldn't be GPL-licensed, the GPL still only applies to the parts of the Bar project that were released under GPL
[01:26.13] <[boxed-pyon]> rangergord: My point is a little bit more subtle. Say Qux, an evil(tm) proprietary software developer wants to use the code in Foo (but not the rest of Bar). Can Bar's developers prevent this, arguing that Bar themselves are redistributing Foo under the GPL3?
[01:26.31] <rangergord> not at all...Foo is MIT, and it will forever remain that way.
[01:27.15] <rangergord> so Qux can use Foo all he wants...the Foo code is MIT.
[01:27.23] <horny-sama> what language is best for writing virus?

[01:28.16] <vdamewood> horny-sama: If you want to write a virus, it must be OS dependent.
[01:28.26] <rangergord> did you know the easiest way to bypass the GPL is to wrap the code in a daemon and access it over pipes/sockets?

[01:29.29] <horny-sama> rindolf: virus not a fan of worm preferably spyware
[01:29.29] <horny-sama> :P
[01:29.31] <rangergord> yeah, AGPL is aimed at that I think
[01:29.34] <vdamewood> rangergord: No. It doesn't, but the AGPL does.
[01:29.36] <rindolf> rangergord: it does?
[01:29.56] <rindolf> [boxed-pyon]: AGPL still allows for proprietary clients.
[01:30.07] <vdamewood> rangergord: Also, the FSF themselves (citation needed), say that if you implement a plugin by forking a process and using IPC, then the GPL doesn't apply there either.
[01:30.08] <rangergord> ＋＋http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tivoization，，  In 2006, Free Software Foundation (FSF) decided to combat TiVo's technical system of blocking users from running modified software.

[01:30.20] <[boxed-pyon]> rindolf: The AGPL is already pushing the boundaries of practicality.

[01:31.09] <[boxed-pyon]> (As awful as Internet Explorer may be as a browser.)
[01:31.29] <vdamewood> Actually, This information is right, the AGPL still doesn't fix the socket boundary.
[01:31.39] <[boxed-pyon]> Oh.
[01:32.01] <vdamewood> The only additional requirement of the AGPL over the GPL is that if there's a download link for the source, your modified version has to have it too.

[01:35.08] <vdamewood> I remember telling a friend of mine that if he wanted to use MySQL (before Oracle bought Sun), the server is GPL, but that wouldn't affect his code. What does affect the licensing of his code is the licensing of the client library.
[01:35.54] <rangergord> MySQL/Oracle is pretty tricky...like if you wanna sell a machine with MySQL pre-installed on it, they try to screw you. I don't see how that violates GPL, but they claim you gotta pay.

[01:36.05] <zzxx> So is it normal to have patches that look like this? ＋＋http://pastie.org/9993005，， - in regards to the attribution at the top. Certainly the original code accounts for the lions share of the code base, but it still seems wierd having my code being attributed to someone else, yet it also seems funny to have an attribution to myself just for the ~20 lines I am adding to the project
[01:37.35] <vdamewood> It's requirement of the GPL to add a statement saying who modified the source, and what date, when making modifications to GPL'd code.
[01:38.07] <rangergord> vdamewood: is that true? wouldn't the Linux kernel code be 50% contributor info in that case?
[01:38.17] <zzxx> vdamewood: ah, ok, so that sould generally go in the comments at the top?

[01:56.29] <rangergord> yeah
[01:57.00] <amigojapan> hey guys, would tmp=weight/hight; BMI=tmp/hight;    be a valid way of calculating metric BMI? I am asking because I suck at math, and scratch does not have a pow function….
[01:57.14] <delta-nry> reaga: because there are several non-numbers (or more precisely, because IEEE said so)
[01:57.21] <rindolf> amigojapan: it's spelled "height" - not "hight"
[01:57.33] <reaga> why did IEEE say so
[01:57.34] <amigojapan> ok rindolf is the math correct?
[01:57.46] <tresgolem> btw I'm using fortran I'm converting to C from an old copy of "computer methods for mathematical computations"
[01:57.47] <rindolf> amigojapan: no idea.
[01:57.51] <amigojapan> ok rindolf
[01:57.53] <delta-nry> reaga: because there is no unique “non-number"
[01:57.54] <tresgolem> stuff like machine epsilon
[01:58.07] <vdamewood> Alas, I have no idea how to calculate BMI.
[01:58.14] <rindolf> amigojapan: you may need to make sure you're not doing an integer division.

[01:58.58] <vdamewood> amigojapan: any reason you're doing a = x/y; b = a/y; instead of b = x/y/y?
[01:59.10] <amigojapan> vdamewood: I saw someone implement it in C using w/h/h    , but that seems to have parsed as w/(h/h) in scratch, that is why I broke it up into a tmp variable
[01:59.13] <Richdog> i'd also just find an online bmi calculator and test yours against that one
[01:59.38] <[boxed-pyon]> "parsed as w/(h/h)" --> whoa, seriously?
[01:59.39] <delta-nry> reaga: NaN is not a single value
[01:59.41] <vdamewood> amigojapan: How about w/(h*h)?
[01:59.58] <amigojapan> ok vdamewood , I will try that,  hold on...
[02:00.58] <delta-nry> reaga: since NaN can arise from different calculations
[02:01.16] <reaga> but it can also arise from the same calcualtions
[02:01.59] <[boxed-pyon]> reaga: The point is that NaN can stand for multiple different values.

[02:12.22] <amigojapan> vdamewood: does it seems like I am teaching all the basics needed for a basic grasp of programming?
[02:12.52] <[boxed-pyon]> reaga: Well, in this case, it *is* an absolute truth. It makes no sense whatsoever to test floating points for equality, unless you're interested in whether their entire computation histories are exactly the same -- which is a very boring notion of equality.
[02:13.14] * MissionCritical (~MissionCr@unaffiliated/missioncritical) has joined channel ##programming

[02:14.04] <amigojapan> rangergord: new people that want to know how to program can come
[02:14.11] <reaga> you are barely aware of what you yourself are saying. there's no chance you could possibly understand what someone else is trying to say to you
[02:14.11] <rangergord> amigojapan: do they ever?
[02:14.28] <vdamewood> amigojapan: I'd put something in to cover what algorithms are and how you might use them, including a comparison of sorts, or an implementation of Euclid's algorithm to show what they are, but don't go into Big-O notation and such.
[02:14.33] <amigojapan> rangergord: to be honest,  there are some people that sorely need this at the hackerspace
[02:14.50] <[boxed-pyon]> reaga: Number equality is all about value equality, unless you're doing really fucked up stuff.
[02:15.08] <[boxed-pyon]> reaga: And if floating points only give you approximate results, then you need to use an approximate notion of equality.
[02:15.10] <tresgolem> btw I'm not doing anything with M_E except reading in the value from <math.h> and trying to print it to the number of digits given in <math.h>

[02:26.59] <vdamewood> tresgolem: Because that value, after compilation, is stored as a binary value. With binary, you have 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, and so on. Thus, you can only represent values in the form n/(2^m)

[02:27.55] <vdamewood> You can't represent 1/10 in binary just like you can't represent 1/3 in decimal.
[02:28.05] <vdamewood> tresgolem: What's the difference?
[02:28.09] <amigojapan> tresgolem: think that should would with just pprintf("\nThe base of natural logarithms M_E: M_E\n", );   since the preprocessor should replace it with the string of that constant
[02:28.29] <amigojapan> printf*
[02:28.51] * amigojapan tries it out...
[02:29.01] <tresgolem> amigojapan yah if I were just treating it as a text string, I'm trying to print it as a float though
[02:29.03] <vdamewood> amigojapan: The preprocessor won't replace inside of strings, otherwise it would replace both M_E's
[02:30.06] <amigojapan> ok vdamewood , hmmm, I dont think that is good behaviour, it shoudl replace inside strings….   but I will take it up with dennis ritchie in teh afterlife :)
[02:31.11] <tresgolem> vdamewood so I think the issue is its related to ieee spec and as you say the limitations of binary encoded deciman values
[02:31.13] <vdamewood> amigojapan: If you have #define FOO "world!" then printf("Hello, " FOO) will concatenate.

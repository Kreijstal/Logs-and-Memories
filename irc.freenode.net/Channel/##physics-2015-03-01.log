[08:09.33] <Slereah_> There's a variety of way to explain it
[08:09.48] * MissionCritical (~MissionCr@unaffiliated/missioncritical) has joined channel ##physics
[08:10.11] <mads__> Could I have the easiest explanation?
[08:10.15] <Slereah_> the common "simple" way it is explained is that the alpha particle exists within the nucleus, and the alpha decay corresponds to the particle being able to tunnel out
[08:10.24] <Slereah_> via quantum tunneling

[09:17.46] * oleo is now known as Guest65749
[09:17.53] <balance> Given: mass, x, dx/dt, p, dp/dt. I need dp²/d²t, how? Just with that. So no m*a=dp²/d²t
[09:18.58] <Slereah_> Do you mean d²p/dt²
[09:19.13] <balance> Slereah_, +
[09:19.15] * oleo__ (~oleo@unaffiliated/oleo) has joined channel ##physics
[09:19.25] <Slereah_> +?
[09:19.30] <balance> Slereah_, yes sure I mean that :)
[09:19.44] <Slereah_> Well if you have dp/dt it's trivial
[09:19.53] <Slereah_> It's just d(dp/dt)/dt
[09:20.27] <Slereah_> Since mechanics is just a second order differential equation, you can find the third derivative from the second
[09:21.04] <balance> Slereah_, ＋＋http://mathb.in/28458，， you mean this?
[09:21.23] * Guest65749 (~oleo@unaffiliated/oleo) Quit (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
[09:22.00] <balance> Slereah_, third form the second? I just want the second and have the first.
[09:22.22] <Slereah_> Well dp/dt = m dx/dt, so third derivative of x
[09:22.32] <Slereah_> But second of p, yeah
[09:22.44] <balance> Slereah_, ah sure, but I don't think I can do that.
[09:24.41] <balance> I don't see how I can calculate d(dp/dt)/dt with the above information only. that's like take the math formula of the first derivative and just derivate it by hand. isn't it?
[09:25.29] <mefistofeles> that's just the second derivative
[09:25.30] <mefistofeles> so yes
[09:26.01] <mefistofeles> second derivative of p, I mean
[09:26.52] <xihr> you were using "impuls" to mean position before, sounds like further confusion
[09:27.04] <xihr> impulse is change in momentum, it's none of those things
[09:27.06] <balance> mefistofeles,  d(dp/dt)/dt what's that in math? I should be able to do this by just x, x', p, p' and m. so I shouldn't have to calculate any second derivative by hand by manipulating a formula.
[09:27.14] * rabbitdew (~rabbitdew@unaffiliated/rabbitdew) has joined channel ##physics
[09:27.19] <balance> p=mv
[09:27.35] <xihr> why are you taking the second derivative?
[09:28.23] * f03lipe (~f03lipe@189.122.208.96) Quit (Quit: Leaving)
[09:28.28] <balance> xihr I need to implement velocity verlet (absoutely new to this) and for that I need the second, don't I, since it's 2nd grade tylor.

[09:29.18] * chris_99 (~chris_99@unaffiliated/chris-99/x-3062929) Quit (Remote host closed the connection)
[09:29.33] <mefistofeles> balance: you don't need second derivative of p for velocity verlet
[09:29.53] <xihr> again: you're thinking of position, not momentum (neither of which is impulse)
[09:29.54] * chris_99 (~chris_99@unaffiliated/chris-99/x-3062929) has joined channel ##physics
[09:30.07] <xihr> this was your confusion the last time you asked a question about "impuls" [sic]
[09:30.13] <The_Cat> in some languages, "impuls" is the word for momentum
[09:30.24] <The_Cat> sometimes things get confusing in translation
[09:30.29] <balance> xihr I don't see you - I think it's a language thing. impuls=momentum
[09:30.43] <balance> xihr lol I mean I don't see what you were trying to point out :P
[09:30.48] <xihr> The_Cat: yes, and as I just said, he doesn't even really meant that

[09:31.04] <balance> mefistofeles, okay possible thanks
[09:31.14] <balance> xihr impuls=mv I meant that
[09:31.39] <mefistofeles> .wiki velocity verlet
[09:31.40] <+dirac> Can't find anything in Wikipedia for "velocity verlet".
[09:31.45] <mefistofeles> .wik velocity verlet
[09:31.47] <xihr> again: that's not what you actually need to do this
[09:32.33] <balance> xihr I absolutely don't get you. Given: position and impuls. that's the exersice...
[09:33.06] <balance> sry momentum
[09:33.57] <mefistofeles> the algorithm for velocity verlet is quite straightforward

[10:06.27] * hmw_ (~user@dslb-088-066-052-124.088.066.pools.vodafone-ip.de) has joined channel ##physics
[10:07.52] <The_Cat> because not only does the energy matter, but also the density of states
[10:08.11] <The_Cat> if a system has only one microstate with the lowest energy, and billions of microstates with a higher energy
[10:08.40] <The_Cat> you will not find the system in the lowest energy state, unless very near 0 K

[10:10.35] <Juris4cm> The_Cat can you please say how it is called when object emits light when X-rays are applied to it?
[10:10.37] <admiralakber> The_Cat: Great - I think my understanding to this level is pretty good then. I'm really liking stat mech, I like how you can generalize it to pretty much any system. m
[10:11.05] <The_Cat> i know the feeling admiralakber, it's a beautiful piece of theoretical machinery
[10:11.15] <Juris4cm> I believe it was something else than fluorecence
[10:11.36] <The_Cat> it's probably fluorecence though
[10:11.38] * bakaneko (~d@AMontsouris-651-1-159-143.w82-123.abo.wanadoo.fr) Quit (Client Quit)
[10:11.51] <The_Cat> which is defined as something which absorbs high energy photons and emits low energy photons
[10:12.30] <Juris4cm> but fluorecence also is from high E field..
[10:12.58] <Juris4cm> Is there some thing which will detect X-rays but will not detect high E field?
[10:13.13] <admiralakber> Scintillation

[10:13.44] <Juris4cm> I just wanna try make homemade X-ray mashine and I need some X-ray detector to know it works
[10:14.18] <Slereah_> Regular photographic film works to detect X rays
[10:14.22] * puddle (uid22609@gateway/web/irccloud.com/x-dftmomuczwvzdwjv) Quit ()
[10:14.25] <Juris4cm> X-rays will be generated with HV so I must differ HV from X rays somehow

[10:14.44] <Juris4cm> Hmm it is some historical thing
[10:14.52] <Juris4cm> I don't have these films in house
[10:15.20] <Juris4cm> Slereah_ is X-rays more energetic than HV?
[10:15.54] <Juris4cm> I wander if I will put fluorescent lamp 1m form X-ray source E field will be not big to get it to work
[10:16.15] <Juris4cm> but can X-rays bring it to light in that big distance?
[10:16.36] * MissionCritical (~MissionCr@unaffiliated/missioncritical) Quit (Max SendQ exceeded)
[10:16.50] <admiralakber> If you have enough X-rays to make something glow that you can see with your naked eyes you probably shouldn't be near the source..
[10:16.51] * km00000 (~km00000@ip-18-16.net.ksu.edu) has joined channel ##physics
[10:16.55] <Slereah_> HV?
[10:17.13] <Juris4cm> these rays will be mostly focused

[10:17.23] * TheBigDeal (~quassel@unaffiliated/innocent99) Quit (Remote host closed the connection)
[10:17.39] <admiralakber> Juris4cm: What do you actually want to do? Make an X-Ray gun or something?
[10:17.41] <Juris4cm> 30W 27kV
[10:17.55] <Juris4cm> ionise air
[10:18.40] <Juris4cm> I need to build X-rays detector somehow
[10:18.55] <admiralakber> Okay -- I don't know why the hell you'd want to do that -- but I'm going to ignore all that -- you can measure radiation using an ionisation chamber. It's a simplish device which just measures electric charge.
[10:19.03] <Juris4cm> what will not be affected with E field
[10:19.04] <admiralakber> It probably is the best detector for your application.
[10:19.08] * MissionCritical (~MissionCr@unaffiliated/missioncritical) has joined channel ##physics
[10:19.39] <Juris4cm> hoho
[10:19.42] <Juris4cm> I know!
[10:19.55] <admiralakber> Just google ionisation chamber
[10:19.57] <Juris4cm> I have build neon light ionization detector
[10:19.57] * Corey84 (~Corey84@unaffiliated/corey84) Quit (Quit: rebooting to xfce 4.11)
[10:20.10] <Juris4cm> I can triger neon bulb even with small UV led
[10:20.25] <Juris4cm> this neon also be triggered with X-rays right?
[10:20.25] <admiralakber> You're ionising air, just measure the charge due to ionisation.
[10:20.44] <admiralakber> Why use light? Just use the charge of the ionised atoms. It's more precise.
[10:21.04] <admiralakber> Also, ionisation chambers are older than the internet.
[10:21.05] <Juris4cm> I said I already have such device
[10:21.13] <admiralakber> Great!
[10:21.15] <Juris4cm> Ok thanx admiralakber!
[10:21.31] <Juris4cm> will look for that but I think my neon ionisation detector must work too
[10:21.48] <admiralakber> Probably, but you won't really see flashes of light unless it's really dark.
[10:22.06] <Juris4cm> no you dont understand
[10:22.09] <Juris4cm> device is simple
[10:22.21] <Juris4cm> it is regulated just 0.5V below ionization
[10:23.12] <Juris4cm> when ionization accured, it just lover glowing ionization level and that voltage is starting enaught to enable neon
[10:23.36] <admiralakber> Do the experiment but don't give yourself or someone else cancer please.
[10:24.20] <Juris4cm> Ok I will try to surge cancer out by myself
[10:24.53] <Juris4cm> I have sharp knife and alchohol!
[10:25.08] <Juris4cm> ok bye thanx for giving me ideas!

[10:29.56] <admiralakber> Put a HV on two plates (i.e. make a massive capacitor) then measure the current on either side of the plates - that will be proportionate to the ionisation after calibration.
[10:30.32] <admiralakber> You don't want so much HV that you spark, just enough to accelerate ions to either plate so that you can measure a pulse.

[10:41.42] <Kuvaro> admiralakber; if you think that space already exists everywhere, then expansion is absolutely worthless
[10:41.57] <eatenSadza> Kuvaro, no it just means the space is getting stretched
[10:42.04] <admiralakber> ^ that
[10:42.23] <admiralakber> Like blowing up a baloon.
[10:42.40] <Kuvaro> was the balloon small once, eatenSadza?
[10:42.44] <byron2> The trivial answer is that nothing existed /at that place/, since I take this to be true even if "where the earth is now" is no well-defined.
[10:43.44] <eatenSadza> well, before you blow up a balloon, the balloon is small.
[10:43.52] <Kuvaro> eatenSadza; expansion is often thought of an "expanding raisin bread" - as the bread expands in a micro-oven, the distances between raisins in the bread also increases. do you agree with this analogy?

[10:46.16] <Kuvaro> eatenSadza; when the raisin bread was small, it did not occupy the entire or much of micro-oven's space. so let's assume that there is a pencil in the micro-oven which is about 11cm away from the raisin bread. the raisin bread is still small, so it is not touching the pencil yet.
[10:46.32] <Kuvaro> eatenSadza; but as it expands and the distances between the raisins in the bread increases, it will touch the pencil. do you agree?

[10:47.05] <Kuvaro> eatenSadza: you can replace the micro-oven with anything, I just added it to make the analogy more understandable
[10:47.19] <eatenSadza> the issue is there very well may be no "anything" to replace it with
[10:47.20] <byron2> Kuvaro: You're begging the question in favor of absolute space when you ask what existed /where the earth is now/ before inflation, right?
[10:47.29] <Kuvaro> eatenSadza; would it be more feasible if I referred to a balloon expanding on the tip of mount everest?
[10:47.31] <admiralakber> Kuvaro: I think I understand your confusion now - in your analogy, the microwave oven is actually the outside of our universe - we don't know what's outside our universe - all our physics is for inside our universe - we are a raisin in the bread..
[10:47.37] <eatenSadza> no
[10:48.10] <admiralakber> Not only are we a raisin in the bread, everything we understand is.
[10:48.18] <Kuvaro> the question is, what existed where the pencil was before the raisin bread expanded and touched it?
[10:48.28] <eatenSadza> you cannot say the pencil existed
[10:48.45] <eatenSadza> you can't even say anything exists outside the bread
[10:48.48] <eatenSadza> the bread is it
[10:49.54] <eatenSadza> the bread is our universe
[10:49.57] <eatenSadza> the bread is existence
[10:50.26] <byron2> Kuvaro: Yes, that's a meaningless question. You're assuming an absolute infinite space, in which our space is expanding.
[10:50.30] <Kuvaro> eatenSadza; did space 70 billion light years away before inflation?
[10:50.44] <eatenSadza> ???
[10:51.02] <Kuvaro> eatenSadza; you seem to have misunderstood the analogy
[10:51.08] <Kuvaro> or perhaps, I expressed it in vague terms
[10:51.09] <eatenSadza> that's not even a sentence
[10:51.48] <eatenSadza> it's definitely in vague terms. there is no microwave. the burden of proof is on you to show me that there is one
[10:52.12] <eatenSadza> then we can talk about space "expanding into" something, but at the moment there is no such concept
[10:52.15] <Kuvaro> <eatenSadza> you can't even say anything exists outside the bread
[10:52.15] <Kuvaro> <eatenSadza> the bread is it
[10:52.15] <Kuvaro> <eatenSadza> the bread is our universe
[10:52.23] <eatenSadza> yes
[10:52.25] <Kuvaro> eatenSadza; the burden of proof is on you, to prove to me that the bread is it

[01:33.00] <Skywise> e = mc^2 says matter is energy
[01:33.38] <Guest82274> Magnetic strength is simply a description of how big the force between the magetic and one unit charge would be
[01:34.14] <Slereah_> Energy is not a substance, no.

[01:34.36] <Guest82274> Skywise: no, it doesn't. mass is... well, just mass, and energy is mass times area divided by time squares
[01:34.38] <Slereah_> Every physical object has a characteristic of energy

[01:35.22] <Guest82274> at least, that's how I understand mass
[01:35.46] <Skywise> Guest82274, Energy = Mass x (Speed of light) Squared
[01:35.46] <nvon> Ok, so you have a definition, but what does it tell you that "mass" exists or "is out there".
[01:35.56] <nvon> ?
[01:36.23] <Slereah_> Really it could even be argued that mass is less fundamental than energy
[01:36.43] <Guest82274> Skywise: speed is length per time unit and squaring it gives length^2/time^2
[01:36.48] <Slereah_> But I don't really try to get into what exists versus not
[01:37.15] <Skywise> Guest82274, its not speed, but the value of the speed of light
[01:37.18] <Slereah_> Guest82274 : You are just using metrology formulas, though
[01:37.19] * Vutral (~ss@mirbsd/special/Vutral) has joined channel ##physics
[01:37.29] <Slereah_> You could just as easily define everything with another set of unit
[01:37.45] <Slereah_> And it has been done
[01:37.51] <Slereah_> Several times, really
[01:38.00] <nvon> Mass, as energy, is just our way of reasoning things "we see". We can measure both and "identify their presence", according to the definition we have created.
[01:38.04] <Slereah_> The fact that we use mass, length and time is somewhat arbitrary
[01:38.06] <nvon> But that's all.
[01:38.22] <Slereah_> Mostly because those are units we could measure easily early on
[01:38.25] <Guest82274> Skywise: well, now you are talking about a very specific form of energy, namely the energy required to create matter with some rest mass
[01:38.57] <Guest82274> the unit of energy is still force * length = mass * length^2/time^2

[01:40.51] <nvon> Guest82274, Well, I think at least I can say it is on the same level as energy. Or maybe energy is "more hidden", that is, it requires deeper reasoning to define it.

[09:37.14] <Pwnna> so what's the difference between things like the streamwise raynold number and Re calculated based on the boundary layer thickness, spanwise.. etc?
[09:37.25] <Pwnna> when to use what and what do they mean?

[09:38.25] <xihr> acg: not really ##physics (it's crystallography, so maybe try something like ##geology?), but quick googling reveals the answer anyway
[09:39.08] <acg> xihr, it took a few references before I found what I belive is the answer
[09:39.24] <acg> I actually did some stuff with miller indices in a modern physics lab; it's not just physics though, of course

[10:03.24] <Maverick> simple question about this problem: A block weighing 74.7 N rests on a plane inclined at 29.5° to the horizontal. The coefficient of the static and kinetic frictions are 0.26 and 0.10 respectively. What is the minimum magnitude of the force F, parallel to the plane, that will prevent the block from slipping?
[10:03.36] * Cs1177 (~Cs1177@104.240.37.1) Quit (Remote host closed the connection)
[10:03.37] <Maverick> the question is, when approaching it, obviously i'll be using the static coefficient since we're talking about it not slipping atm
[10:04.04] <Maverick> so on our FBD we've got both the force pulling in a positive on the parallel (that's how I set my FBD up)
[10:04.19] <Maverick> but which way would this static friction be going, since we aren't accelerating or moving?
[10:04.20] * tubuliferous (~tubulifer@64.89.97.100) Quit (Quit: My Mac has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[10:04.46] <monoprotic> static friction is in whichever direction is necessary to prevent it from slipping
[10:04.46] <sujeet> Maverick, it will be going "up the ramp"
[10:04.46] <Maverick> would it be going against the mgcos(theta), or against the force?
[10:04.52] <Maverick> okay positive with my force
[10:05.03] <PlanckWalk> There is a range of forces where the block won't slip.  At the minimum, "upward"
[10:05.04] <Maverick> ooh that makes sense monoprotic
[10:05.10] <PlanckWalk> At the maximum "downward"

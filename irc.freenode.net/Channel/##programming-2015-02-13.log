[11:00.53] Channel Created on: 5:23 AM 2/4/2007
[11:00.57] <ScriptKitty> I have been using that, then I started thinking..
[11:01.04] <Myrl> pyon: amigojapan Serpentine_ ＋＋http://puu.sh/fTknv.png，，
[11:01.07] <SailorR> X_C_V_B is a troll
[11:01.09] <SailorR> @ops
[11:01.16] <ScriptKitty> what if push had a backdoor?
[11:01.18] <Rainb> Damn, I never find any good clients
[11:01.27] * ablest1980 (~ablest198@50.12.14.151) has joined channel ##programming
[11:01.30] <amigojapan> ah ok ScriptKitty ,, nice
[11:01.31] <Rainb> I installed hexchat and it crashes in windows 8
[11:01.38] <SailorR> amigojapan
[11:01.39] <Rainb> ScriptKittyoh my god you're here
[11:01.40] <SailorR> I remember u
[11:01.45] <Rainb> OH WOW
[11:01.48] <amigojapan> hi SailorR
[11:01.48] --ablest1980-- logged in with account (ablest1980)
[11:01.48] * day- (~day@unaffiliated/day) has joined channel ##programming
[11:01.52] <Myrl> Rainb: ScriptKitty I remember both of you.
[11:01.53] <SailorR> hi
[11:01.56] <Myrl> You too, day-.
[11:01.56] <SailorR> did you meet sailormoon yet
[11:01.58] <amigojapan> SailorR: are  you a Sailor Moon fan?
[11:02.00] <Rainb> Sorry I didn't reply to you last time
[11:02.01] <ScriptKitty> hello ^^
[11:02.03] <Rainb> I was afk
[11:02.09] <SailorR> I am sailormoon
[11:02.09] <ScriptKitty> it's ok
[11:02.14] <haya600> scriptkitty can you get sued if your project breaks on freelancer and is how much exp should I have before using freelancer?
[11:02.17] <amigojapan> SailorR: meet? that would be quite difficult
[11:02.22] <SailorR> why
[11:02.27] <ScriptKitty> no
[11:02.29] <ScriptKitty> I cannot
[11:02.34] <ScriptKitty> I did not sign anything
[11:02.51] <Rainb> haya600, you need to be an Indian level 65 in order to join freelancer.com
[11:02.51] <ScriptKitty> or make any promises
[11:03.09] <amigojapan> Myrl: this is the ALU I designed in logicly,  every chip, I also desined the NAND gates inside ＋＋http://i.imgur.com/1fkd2KA.jpg，，
[11:03.14] * Nevox (~Nevox@x2f55b4f.dyn.telefonica.de) Quit (Quit: Leaving)
[11:03.17] <Serpentine_> Well, the converse is also true; you cannot force a client to pay you for completing their work if you give the completed project first.
[11:03.25] <amigojapan> SailorR: cause Sailor Moon is not real
[11:03.30] <haya600> I'm a beginner is freelancer a good way to get some finished projects on my resume, what are your thoughts?
[11:03.44] * STumbles (~stumbles@c-24-17-164-127.hsd1.wa.comcast.net) has joined channel ##programming
[11:03.44] --STumbles-- logged in with account (sstumbles)
[11:03.49] <Rainb> "Stay away from that crap", that's probably what I think
[11:04.04] * antons (~antons@199.48.120.7) has joined channel ##programming
[11:04.08] <Rainb> Do something like FOSS work for your resume, dunno
[11:04.16] <_X_C_V_B_> you guys must be bored to create logic gate stuff
[11:04.17] * agorecki (~agorecki@unaffiliated/agorecki) Quit (Ping timeout: 246 seconds)
[11:04.29] <Rainb> OR fascinated
[11:04.42] <amigojapan> Rainb: I got something made for me in freelancer , some artwork for 50 dollars, it was not bad….  it was someone frome Romania
[11:04.49] * day (~day@unaffiliated/day) Quit (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[11:05.03] <amigojapan> _X_C_V_B_: it is fun
[11:05.17] <Myrl> amigojapan: Damn. What are the functions?
[11:05.34] <Myrl> Oh.
[11:05.36] <Rainb> it's like saying math is boring, not logical
[11:05.37] <Myrl> It's at the bottomright.
[11:05.55] <_X_C_V_B_> amigojapan: now go build your own computer from ICs
[11:06.11] <Rainb> _X_C_V_B_: I want to make my own computar
[11:06.23] <Rainb> 2 DIY 4 u
[11:06.26] <amigojapan> Myrl: it can ADD OR XOR NAND and AND 2 values
[11:06.48] <Rainb> It will be from NOR gates
[11:06.49] <amigojapan> _X_C_V_B_: I am planning to build a computer out of relays
[11:06.53] <Rainb> instead of NAND gates
[11:07.02] <Rainb> cause everyone uses NAND gates for no reason
[11:07.02] <haya600> i made a logic gate computer with my own blood as the wiring
[11:07.11] <Myrl> amigojapan: xor? by supressing carry?
[11:07.27] <Rainb> or what if I make a computer with each gate being it's own gate
[11:07.30] <Serpentine_> Well, everyone uses NAND gates because it's cheaper to manufacture and operate
[11:07.39] <_X_C_V_B_> relays?
[11:07.42] <_X_C_V_B_> really
[11:07.51] <amigojapan> Myrl: I think so
[11:07.53] * boB_K7IQ (~IceChat9@static-50-125-97-34.myvi.wa.frontiernet.net) Quit (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[11:07.59] <_X_C_V_B_> there so fucking slow
[11:08.19] <Rainb> what is more abstract than a logic gate
[11:08.29] <_X_C_V_B_> python
[11:08.46] <Serpentine_> An advanced computer
[11:08.55] <Myrl> amigojapan: ＋＋http://puu.sh/fTllj.png，，
[11:08.55] <amigojapan> _X_C_V_B_: did you know someone made a “computer” using domino chips? it could add 2 binary values
[11:09.00] <Myrl> amigojapan: 2-bit multiplier.
[11:09.05] <amigojapan> one sec Myrl
[11:09.11] <Serpentine_> (Despite hearing the word "abstraction" being tossed around frequently, I still do not entirely know it's meaning)
[11:09.17] <_X_C_V_B_> amigojapan: yes
[11:09.17] <Myrl> amigojapan: With a transistorized version.
[11:09.28] <Rainb> Serpentine_: It means ignoring information
[11:09.53] <Rainb> say you have a blue chair, so in order to abstract it, you delete details
[11:09.56] <Myrl> Rainb: More like implying information.
[11:10.04] <Rainb> so it's no longer a blue chair, just a chair
[11:10.27] <haya600> you dont haev tow orry about the tiny details like 1's and 0's when you're abstracting
[11:10.38] <Rainb> or you could just ignore more information, and just say it's a furniture
[11:10.38] <Serpentine_> Alright, that does make more sense.
[11:10.58] <Rainb> and then you can just ignore more information and say it's an object
[11:11.15] <amigojapan> Myrl: interesting,   but I did not think making a multiplier was important, cause multipliacation can be implemented by software
[11:11.31] <Rainb> so you can almost always abstract more, but sometimes more abstraction mean losong details which are essential
[11:11.42] <Rainb> so just don't abstract the important information
[11:11.51] <Myrl> amigojapan: I was experimenting with K-maps there. :P
[11:12.05] <amigojapan> ok Myrl
[11:12.14] * saint_ (~saint_@gateway/vpn/privateinternetaccess/saint/x-59675695) Quit (Quit: UNIVERSE CORRUPTED. REBOOT (Y/N) ?)
[11:13.01] <_X_C_V_B_> to abstract even it's a thing
[11:13.02] <_X_C_V_B_> *more
[11:13.16] <Rainb> then it is an idea
[11:13.27] <amigojapan> _X_C_V_B_: here is a relay computer ＋＋https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yntpJwNC6N8，，
[11:13.30] <Rainb> and there is nothing more abstract than ideas, or is it
[11:13.55] <Rainb> the only thing more abstract than ideas is nothingness, maybe
[11:14.09] * lillian (~lillian@unaffiliated/lillian) Quit (Quit: Going to the end of the universe)
[11:16.13] * threadNecromance (~sebastian@c-24-21-197-80.hsd1.or.comcast.net) Quit (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)

[11:17.49] <amigojapan> I like how he calls a bunch of jumpers the “ROM” :)
[11:18.17] <Rainb> I get the reference.
[11:18.44] <Sadale> amigojapan, wow. holy crap
[11:18.55] <Sadale> amigojapan, looks like dinosaur.
[11:19.07] <amigojapan> Sadale: I like that guy’s projects, he has made many cool projects....
[11:19.28] <haya600> what are computers good for
[11:19.39] <amigojapan> haya600: porn
[11:19.42] <Myrl> amigojapan: Well, they technically are ROM.
[11:19.44] <Sadale> amigojapan, I hear the flipping sound of the relays
[11:19.49] <Serpentine_> haya600: cat videos
[11:20.03] <amigojapan> yeah Sadale , that is quite interesting to me
[11:20.28] <Sadale> amigojapan, it's a "because I can" project, obviously.
[11:20.37] <Myrl> amigojapan: OH DAMN, I LOVE THAT GUY. MOSTLY WITH DUO ADEPTH
[11:21.33] <_X_C_V_B_> ＋＋https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdT1YT9AOPA，， <-- The K'nuter - K'NEX Computer
[11:21.44] <amigojapan> Myrl: his earlier projects are better than the recent ones
[11:22.00] <Myrl> amigojapan: Yeah. He seems to be out of ideas.
[11:22.13] <Myrl> Duo light and the ASCII one isn't really good.
[11:22.13] <haya600> sounds like he should stop living in the 50's
[11:22.16] <Sadale> amigojapan, The relay computer is equivalent to 特殊物品(hold on. I am checking the english of it) in neopets :p
[11:22.38] <Myrl> amigojapan: The duo mega's very good though.
[11:22.39] <amigojapan> Myrl: now he is basically remaking an arduino kind of computer, which he wants to sell
[11:23.08] <Myrl> amigojapan: Yeah.
[11:23.20] <amigojapan> ok Sadale
[11:23.21] <Serpentine_> (特殊物品 -> special items)
[11:23.36] <Sadale> Serpentine_, IKR. But I want the in-game translation
[11:23.44] <Myrl> amigojapan: I still want to know the schematic for this though. ＋＋https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUJcQ5pioW8，，
[11:23.55] * Corey84 (~Corey84@unaffiliated/corey84) has joined channel ##programming
[11:24.36] <amigojapan> Sadale: Myrl , I like this one of his projects a lot ＋＋https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYvr0b8jqbg，，
[11:24.43] <Serpentine_> I would be amazed if I could see a video of a fully mechanical computer doing a non-trivial computation
[11:24.45] * Sadale clicks
[11:24.47] <haya600> that poor dog prlaby has water in his ear
[11:24.52] <haya600> why do you abuse animals like that
[11:24.58] <Myrl> amigojapan: I also like the OISC.
[11:25.05] * haya600 (62a9b15b@gateway/web/freenode/ip.98.169.177.91) Quit (Quit: Page closed)
[11:25.11] <amigojapan> Myrl: what is that?
[11:25.13] <Sadale> amigojapan, that guy got too much tie to waste ;_;
[11:25.15] <Myrl> amigojapan: The Duo BASIC is also pretty good.
[11:25.23] <Serpentine_> Like for instance, calculating the first few digits of pi and pressing it's binary equivalent as dots on paper
[11:25.34] <amigojapan> Myrl: does nto impress me much, that is simillar to my arduino retro computer
[11:25.51] <Myrl> amigojapan: Here. ＋＋https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoMgCrOT3fU，，
[11:26.06] <Myrl> amigojapan: His new ones don't really impress me. Duo Light, Duo Decimal...
[11:26.13] <Myrl> He lost his practicality.
[11:26.24] <amigojapan> I am watching
[11:27.39] <Myrl> amigojapan: I find the Duo Mega to be interesting though.
[11:27.42] <amigojapan> Myrl: have you seen my arudino retro computer?
[11:27.48] <Myrl> amigojapan: Nope.
[11:28.15] <Myrl> Most of his new projects are simply just an Atmega with a bootloader... pretty much an Arduino.
[11:28.29] <amigojapan> Myrl: this was my first arduino retro computer ＋＋http://amigojapan.github.io/Arduino-Retro-Computer-with-SD-card-and-LCD-display-and-Keyboard-input-with-BASIC-interpreter/，，

[11:29.44] <amigojapan> yes Myrl
[11:29.47] <Sadale> amigojapan, life is short. There are way too many thing I want to do :(
[11:29.53] <jeaye> Serpentine_: Does the fib sequence count?
[11:30.01] <Sadale> amigojapan, so many amateur project to be completed :<
[11:30.01] <amigojapan> Sadale: we need to be efficient
[11:30.17] * bea571e (~unknown@23-118-113-201.lightspeed.mmphtn.sbcglobal.net) has left ##programming (("sic - 250 LOC are too much!"))
[11:30.24] <Serpentine_> jeaye: Well, for a fully mechanical computer it would be quite impressive

[11:46.40] <n90> Myrl: noes
[11:46.49] <n90> move immediate address
[11:46.52] <Myrl> Ah.
[11:47.15] <n90> its the last line of assembler im not sure with
[11:47.20] <Myrl> I'm still confused.
[11:47.21] <n90> add immediate value 1234 to r9
[11:47.24] <pyon> amigojapan: I was almost going to ask you "subbed by whom?", then I remembered you live in Japan and know Japanese...
[11:47.51] <Myrl> pyon: lol.
[11:48.08] <amigojapan> pyon: yeah, but I watched it on animeplus… I think they have “horrible subs” usually, is that wat it is called? something like that
[11:48.19] <pyon> Ah!
[11:48.26] <Myrl> n90: I'm guessing it's the equivalent of lea.

[11:49.11] <n90> Myrl: yes I would assume so
[11:49.26] <amigojapan> pyon: sometimes it is interesting to compare the original Japanese to the subs of anime…. I did that a lot with Sailor Moon Crystal….
[11:49.50] <Myrl> n90: Anyways. If I were to make that, everything would be in the registers.
[11:49.51] <pyon> amigojapan: Well, sadly I don't know Japanese, so...
[11:50.09] <amigojapan> pyon: but Sailor Moon Crystal’s subs where made by the same company that made the anime
[11:50.32] <pyon> :-O
[11:51.12] <Myrl> Damn it.
[11:51.22] <amigojapan> pyon: they decided to use something like “silly mom” instead of “mom you idiot” which is what she said in the original Japanese, and stuff liek that

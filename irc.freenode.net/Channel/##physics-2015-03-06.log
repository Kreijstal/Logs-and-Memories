[05:09.38] <marad> hi, I've been recently puzzled by this kind of Feynman diagram: ＋＋http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Feynman_EP_Annihilation.svg，，
[05:10.36] <marad> I wander, what does the propagator for the horizontal fermion line even look like?
[05:10.52] <marad> it's neither retarded nor advanced
[05:11.04] <marad> and it seems to have infinite momentum end energy
[05:11.37] <marad> naively pruging that in would give zero probability amplitude
[05:11.45] <marad> does anyone know?
[05:12.14] <marad> s/pruging/pluging
[05:12.15] <+dirac> marad meant to say: naively pluging that in would give zero probability amplitude

[07:16.45] <isaac_noton2> The reciprocal lattice of the reciprocal lattice is the lattice itself. From the mathematical definition, that is obvious. What about physically, is there something we can think of?
[07:17.21] <The_Cat> the basic rules of fourier transform apply
[07:17.22] <isaac_noton2> Even if it has a bit of mathematics in it, like fourier analysis?
[07:17.35] <The_Cat> flat bands correspond to localized states
[07:17.53] <The_Cat> highly metallized states have well-defined energies

[07:22.31] <The_Cat> erm, well defined wavelengths*, sorry
[07:23.05] <The_Cat> it's fourier, if it's localized in space, it's spread out in wavelength, and vice versa

[07:56.40] <zeitue> question "A baseball is thrown straight up returns to the point it was released after 3.8 s. Find the speed of the ball as it is released."
[07:56.40] <zeitue> from what I can tell it should be like this v = v0 + at, I solve it for v0 and get v0 = v - at and then plug in the numbers v0 = v + 9.8(3.8)
[07:56.40] <zeitue> would the final velocity be 0? which would cause the initial velocity to be 37.24 or would the final velocity be something else?

[07:57.57] * blablaa (~z@unaffiliated/blablaa) Quit (Quit: Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[07:58.32] <zeitue> I think it should be 0 on returning but it might have a final velocity that would be much higher
[07:58.34] <chill|out> final velocity = v(3,8s) ?
[07:58.57] <KAHR-Alpha> zeitue: when you throw something at the sky, does it land on your face with 0 velocity?
[07:59.26] <zeitue> no it would hit with a lot of force from what I know

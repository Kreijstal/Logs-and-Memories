[12:00.09] <haya600> hey I don't know if this is the right channel but does anyone know a good shared webhost for a small website?
[12:00.26] * LordWillO (~LordWillO@173-31-169-165.client.mchsi.com) has joined channel ##programming

[12:01.01] * Xardov (~Xardov@113.163.118.155) Quit (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[12:02.48] <vdamewood> haya600: I have 1&1. It's okay, but I don't like how it handles SSL, so I'm thinking of switching. A friend had blue host. I liked it, except that they wouldn't let me configure where my sites were located in a secure way.
[12:02.56] * Programmer_ (~khaotic@unaffiliated/khaotic) has joined channel ##programming
[12:03.03] <vdamewood> Well, they wouldn't let me configure how *her* sites were stored.
[12:03.36] <vdamewood> GoDaddy is terrible. They require that you store everything in DocumentRoot for your primary site, which is a big security no-no.
[12:03.47] <jeaye> Don't use HostMonster.
[12:03.48] * DarkCthulhu (~DarkCthul@unaffiliated/darkcthulhu) Quit (Quit: Leaving)
[12:03.59] * cluelessperson (~cluelessp@cpe-76-184-197-40.tx.res.rr.com) has joined channel ##programming
[12:04.01] <jeaye> Terrible support, terrible prices, terrible software, etc.
[12:04.01] <grandpatrolling> nearlyfreespeech.net
[12:04.17] <cluelessperson> hey guys
[12:04.22] <jeaye> If you decide against shared, I strongly recommend DigitalOcean.
[12:04.43] * it0a (~it0a@cpe-76-189-250-113.neo.res.rr.com) Quit (Ping timeout: 246 seconds)
[12:04.47] <cluelessperson> Does anyone know how to setup a simple TUNNEL over port 80?
[12:04.56] <vdamewood> How much do VPS's cost these days?
[12:05.00] <cluelessperson> I need my work server to connect to my home server for backups
[12:05.04] * CustosL1men (~CustosLim@unaffiliated/cust0slim3n) Quit (Ping timeout: 246 seconds)
[12:05.16] * meh (575c0b27@gateway/web/freenode/ip.87.92.11.39) has joined channel ##programming
[12:05.30] <cluelessperson> vdamewood, I've never used, one, don't like the idea of paying someone else for something that should be easy.
[12:05.34] <_X_C_V_B_> I was going to go with DigitalOcean when I get my website/game done.
[12:05.43] <cluelessperson> vdamewood, also, I don't like the idea of introducing a 3rd party to the loo
[12:05.55] * meh (575c0b27@gateway/web/freenode/ip.87.92.11.39) Quit (Client Quit)

[12:06.45] * arescorpio (~arescorpi@197-241-16-190.fibertel.com.ar) Quit (Excess Flood)
[12:06.49] <vdamewood> DO?
[12:06.49] <jeaye> But they give away free credits like nobody's business. I won't be paying them for the next year.
[12:06.55] <jeaye> DigitalOcean
[12:06.56] <vdamewood> Ohh... Nevermind.
[12:07.28] <vdamewood> jeaye: And that's for a VPS? I think I'm paying $4/mo for shared hosting right now. Not a bad deal.
[12:07.32] <jeaye> That's the cheapest, anyway. Goes up to $60/month or so. $5 or $10 should be all most people need.
[12:07.42] <jeaye> vdamewood: Their support is unbeatable.
[12:08.05] <vdamewood> echo "Digital Ocean" >> ~/VpsHostsToLookAt.txt

[12:09.39] <cluelessperson> vdamewood, sorry.  Basically, does there exist a simple solution that doesn't require bringing a third party into the network?

[12:12.57] <haya600> if i use digital ocean do i have to worry about website security?
[12:13.52] <_X_C_V_B_> cluelessperson: from my understanding you want to send files over the internet. Is that right?

[12:14.26] <cluelessperson> _X_C_V_B_, essentially.  I might be best off SSH tunneling to a home VM or something.  I haven't set up a home linux server yet
[12:14.34] <cluelessperson> Need hardware.

[12:15.52] <Snake2k> Nes173: Idk which syntax that is, but my guess is mem location to mem location, both being source and destination if it is cmd source, dest
[12:16.09] <Snake2k> Nes173: Nvm, it's the other way
[12:16.10] <_X_C_V_B_> haya600: there's heroku

[01:55.38] <subhazard> I doubt anyone but the very most lucky, talented, and wealthy will be making any impact on human knowledge in this generation or the next, due to the student loan bubble

[01:57.55] <f1ay> I came from a poor area, wasn't homeless but I did live in a pretty humble building without any walls or ceiling. Almost everyone I grew up with thinks that you don't learn anything in a university. They sit around and smoke a lot of weed. Most of them do basement water sealing now. I'm staring down the barrel of a few pretty good jobs as a result of going to school. I don't know what the hell you guys
[01:57.56] <subhazard> I wouldn't be too worried about global warming to be honest.  We've made the neccesary changes, and the environment is healing as a result.  The same can't be said for Asia though, China's ruining that for everyone.
[01:57.57] <f1ay> are talking about
[01:58.19] <GeneralVagueness> how can you have a building without any walls or ceiling?
[01:58.31] <subhazard> The fact that you can go several tens of thousand dollars in debt, and still end up working at Arbies.
[01:58.43] <f1ay> GeneralVagueness: interior walls. It was all insulation
[01:58.44] <CoJaBo> subhazard: It's literally beyond repair lol. Even if we somehow fixed 100% of the emissions problems tonight, it's already too late.
[01:58.45] <Lady_Aleena> CoJaBo, what did your roof need to have done which took half a year?

[02:27.55] <nitrxgen> CoJaBo, im an EMT (I do emergency driving) :D and a web dev, and electronic hobbyist,
[02:27.58] <pyon> grill: It is easy to prove that, if A is context-free, so is SUFFIX(A).
[02:28.08] <pyon> grill: First, note that context-free languages are closed under concatenation.
[02:28.10] <nitrxgen> which reminds me, i gotta go
[02:28.15] <grill> yes

[02:31.36] <o0elise0o> he likes it when i draw on his face with highlighter
[02:31.50] <nitrxgen> CoJaBo, yeah I've seen enough, I have 2 jobs, full time and part time, both driving, I see plenty, trust me
[02:31.52] <pyon> grill: Every string is split in two parts. Then, you put first parts into one language, and the second parts into another language.
[02:32.09] <grill> so all I need to do is show that if all the strings in both halves are regular, so is the concatenated language
[02:32.10] <grill> ww
[02:32.11] <grill> o
[02:32.13] <grill> wow

[02:32.27] <nitrxgen> there's a high influx of motorbike accidents here lately too... as a motorcyclist myself, gotta be extra watchful
[02:32.41] <Lady_Aleena> CoJaBo, good night. I have to go.

[02:33.06] <thecoolguy> Do you know how o0elise0o ?
[02:33.10] <grill> or rather, regular languages are closed under concatenation
[02:33.11] <pyon> grill: But what we want to prove is that, if B is context-free, so is SUFFIX(B).
[02:33.16] <nitrxgen> anyway i got training in 1.5 hours in a place i dont even know, opposite side of the city
[02:33.29] <nitrxgen> should probably gtfo
[02:33.38] <CoJaBo> nitrxgen: He eventually swerves wildly around me, cuts me off, *looks back and flips me off* as he starts to pass the truck. Truck swerves to miss the pallets, sends Sir Derp-A-Lot up into the dividers.
[02:33.52] <pyon> grill: So let B be a context-free language, and let A be the language that contains all strings [formed using the terminals in B's alphabet].
[02:34.19] <pyon> grill: A is regular [and its DFA is trivial: it contains a single accepting state].
[02:34.24] <pyon> grill: And all regular languages are context-free.
[02:34.33] <thecoolguy> o0elise0o were you serious or joking :( ?
[02:34.36] <pyon> grill: So A is context-free and B is context-free. Therefore, so is AB.

[02:41.39] <grill> it depends on the use case

[02:41.49] <CoJaBo> I've worked on one a bit, but had no clue how it actually worked
[02:42.04] <grill> i am probably going to use both an HMM + a syntactic parser for a project i'm working on

[02:44.23] <pyon> CoJaBo: I remember having fun making a compiler for a C-like language in college. But making a compiler for a ML-like language [with closures, higher-order functions, higher-order modules] is proving more painful than I predicted it would be.

[02:54.09] <pyon> grill: Ask.
[02:54.17] <grill> how do you know that A has a single accept state
[02:54.40] <pyon> grill: Because A accepts any string.
[02:54.48] <pyon> grill: Errr, A contains every string.
[02:54.58] <pyon> grill: Thus, the DFA for A must accept every string.
[02:55.23] * wz1000 (~wz1000@182.64.236.61) has joined channel ##programming
[02:55.33] <grill> contains every string that can be made with the terminals of B?
[02:55.34] <pyon> grill: Thus, the minimal DFA for A contains just a single state, and it is an accepting state. Every transition is a loopback to that single state.
[02:55.39] <pyon> grill: Yep.
[02:55.53] <pyon> Every string that can be made with the terminals of B.
[02:56.25] <grill> and the terminals themselves can be strings
[02:56.39] <pyon> grill: Errr... No.

[02:56.51] <pyon> grill: Normally a terminal is one symbol.

[04:36.42] <pyon> floatingpoint: The rotation 0 always leaves the string untouched.

[04:37.26] <pyon> In general, the rotation i takes the first i characters and moves to the end of the string.
[04:37.46] <pyon> Okay, now notice that applying the rotation "i" and then the rotation "j" is the same as applying the rotation "i + j".

[04:49.24] <pyon> floatingpoint: However, given a string of length "n", if we first apply the rotation denoted by "i" and then the rotation denoted by "j", it is as if we had applied a single rotation - the one denoted by "(i + j) mod n".

[06:09.30] <Twey> Polarities, linearity, &c. is all about effects from the start: they expose the actual computation done in the interpretation of the terms.  There's no *pure* difference between a thunk and a value, which is why Haskell can get away with it

[06:11.35] <Twey> If you're satisfied with just talking about what the term will eventually evaluate to, there's no need for CBPV, game semantics, linearity, &c.  The point of these tools is that they let you make statements about *how* it will be evaluated.  The fact that this helps you think about effects is coïncidental, in that the occurrence of effects coïncides with certain evaluation steps, so by reasoning about
[06:11.36] <Twey> when those steps occur you can also reason about when the effects happen

[06:16.49] <Twey> It's just syntax, but it's very nice syntax.  And the parallel addition of std::function means we now have a much more general way of talking about functions as (almost) first-class types.

[06:54.39] <Myrl> C, is, high-level.
[06:54.58] <ams> Myrl: not really .. C was considered a macro assembler from day one, we had far higher level languages when C showed its ugly face

[07:00.42] <ams> vdamewood: hm?
[07:00.43] <pyon> Twey: I also need to make use of the property [whenever it actually holds] that n is a lot less than std::numeric_limits< std::uintptr_t >::max().
[07:00.46] <Twey> The only thing you'd have to do differently to e.g. Haskell is remove the pointer indirection

[07:01.31] <Plastefuchs> Nah, you lick immigration
[07:01.34] <Twey> pyon: n has no runtime representation (… here)
[07:01.41] <vdamewood> Or am I completely wrong, and it went straight for 11?
[07:02.00] <pyon> Twey: Oh, a priori you cannot tell that the compiler will assign the bit pattern 000...0 for 0, 000...1 for 1, 000...10 for 2, etc.

[07:02.32] <Twey> pyon: Well, that's a different matter
[07:02.55] <pyon> Twey: So it doesn't follow from the code alone that modular arithmetic in Fin n is O(lg n).

[07:03.14] <Twey> pyon: But the *compiler* knows that

[07:27.17] <Ace__> quick one here: I have an int n defined in a void function and I want to use that n in the main function how do I go doing that?
[07:27.24] <Ace__> c++ btw
[07:28.30] <vdamewood> Ace__: How do you want to use it?
[07:28.51] <pyon> This sounds like an instance of the XY problem.
[07:29.00] <vdamewood> pyon: Agreed.
[07:29.22] <Ace__> I'm using it as in for (int i=0; i <n; ++i)
[07:29.52] <pyon> Ace__: What does your void function do?
[07:30.30] <vdamewood> Oh yeah, I remember what I was working on. Having plus signs in a projects name breaks building the package, I think.
[07:30.52] <Ace__> well....the voice function builds up an fcc lattice, so the int n will be the number of atoms i.e. it's only used inside the for loop in the void func
[07:31.20] <pyon> What's an "fcc lattice"?

[07:34.45] <Ace__> mnnn will that work though? cause it's like this:   int n = 0 ...(a few for loops) ++n   at the end of the loops in the void func

[09:17.03] <blizzy> that's really all the difference is.
[09:17.06] <txdv_> aidanh: the implies that you talk to people and i dont believe that
[09:17.11] <txdv_> you only communicate with people over irc
[09:17.11] <aidanh> Python 2 -> 3 has to be the worst language transition ever ._>

[09:17.51] <Plastefuchs> blizzy: nah, way way more
[09:18.15] <brastologix> Python 3 is the future of the language they say. Python 2 is legacy and wouldn't be supported after 2018 they say.
[09:18.29] <txdv_> python2 will never die
[09:18.43] <brastologix> There are many improvements I just went through the docs.

[09:19.15] <txdv_> the best improvement of C is called objective C
[09:19.34] <brastologix> Python2 has a great many volume of projects but slowly they're all being ported to 3 but it's no big deal.
[09:19.36] <txdv_> It is blazing fast as lisp and has the memory safety features of C

[09:22.40] <hanshenrik__> txdv_, i don't know lisp or their dialects
[09:22.43] <txdv_> as long as there 2 programmers and 2 languages there will be 2**32 opinions on what language to choose

I am debating on what would be a good language to use to build this GUI. I was thinking something web based or via QT. Any suggestions?

[12:38.13] <Twey> amigojapan: Real computers being finite means you can get some interesting results from them.  For example, the halting problem is actually *solvable* — you can write a Turing machine that takes a real program using finite memory and tells you whether it halts or not (simply by running the program and seeing whether the total state of the machine is repeated).  Not quickly, but in finite time.

[12:46.49] <UberLambda> ams: yeah, the book?
[12:46.53] <ams> yes
[12:46.59] <UberLambda> So? lol
[12:47.15] <Soni> so I made this spec: ＋＋https://gist.github.com/SoniEx2/c679e771d506210378a5，， (it needs some polishing but it's pretty good IMO)

[12:47.54] * UberLambda hopes that .gifs will die soon
[12:48.08] <UberLambda> Also, I hope that there won't be the need of animated images anymore
[12:48.10] <Soni> so like idk much about MNG, so I can't compare it myself, but I'd say MPNGPNG can do most of what MNG can (e.g. can't do JNG), and more! (a lot more actually!)
[12:48.13] <Vladimirski> ams: did you mean SICP to learn how software is built?
[12:48.14] <UberLambda> with .webm and such
[12:48.18] <Soni> for example, it's streaming
[12:48.26] <ams> Vladimirski: no

[12:48.44] <Soni> e.g. you could use it in something similar to twitch.tv
[12:48.50] <Vladimirski> ok
[12:48.51] <Soni> (well, there's no built-in audio, but w/e)
[12:49.07] <UberLambda> Soni: does it use a codec? Otherwise it's pretty useless
[12:49.16] <Soni> UberLambda, is PNG a codec?
[12:49.22] <UberLambda> Soni: nope
[12:49.41] <Soni> UberLambda, but it works great to compress screenshots of my IDE!
[12:49.45] <UberLambda> Gifs waste a lot of space more than a video
[12:50.04] <UberLambda> In a video the codec stores the difference between frames, not the full frame
[12:50.19] <Soni> well this thing supports everything APNG supports
[12:50.24] <UberLambda> Imagine 5000 frames with the same image. In a video it can be easily compressed with a good codec
[12:50.36] <UberLambda> e.g "repeat this frame 5000 times"
[12:50.43] <Soni> yeah, I can do that
[12:50.44] <UberLambda> with a .apng I don't think it's the case
[12:50.47] <UberLambda> or is it^

[12:51.08] <Soni> "repeat this frame for the next 65535 seconds"
[12:51.27] <UberLambda> Yeah but does it handle difference, too?
[12:51.28] <pecorade> UberLambda i think it's more efficient store some delta between slighly different frames.
[12:51.36] <UberLambda> pecorade: that's what I meant
[12:51.42] <Soni> yes, you can keep the old frame contents and update just what you need
[12:51.45] <UberLambda> A codec stores the delta between frames
[12:51.47] <UberLambda> Soni: cool then
[12:51.59] <Soni> that's all from APNG
[12:52.00] <UberLambda> But is it any different than, say, a .webm?
[12:52.06] <Soni> and my thing supports everything from APNG
[12:52.07] <pecorade> UberLambda the problem is to entablish a compression threshold.
[12:52.25] <rindolf> Wow! What a day! I think I want to faint.
[12:52.29] <Soni> but it also supports livestreams (aka unspecified number of frames) and compositing images
[12:52.29] <pecorade> which varies the ratio quality / size
[12:52.47] <UberLambda> pecorade: well, more compression = trouble with large areas being updated, right?
[12:52.48] <pecorade> UberLambda it's a simple thing and most codecs already do that.
[12:52.56] <Soni> so let's say you have 4 animated images, _with different loop points_
[12:53.06] <pecorade> the real problem is to compress large images
[12:53.14] <Soni> you want to put the 4 in the same image, make them loop at their own loop points

[12:53.44] <Soni> for an APNG (and probably for an MNG too), you'd have to make a huge image until all the loop points... match?
[12:54.18] * oujh (~vfbtgn@188.25.39.182) has joined channel ##programming
[12:54.20] <UberLambda> hm, but not with your format?
[12:54.20] <Soni> with this thing, you literally just shove the 4 animated images in the file, tell them to be drawn on each of the 4 corners
[12:54.25] <UberLambda> It could have some applications
[12:54.40] <UberLambda> I don't think it would be useful in videos though
[12:54.51] <UberLambda> Maybe for some things such as the bottom animated logo

[12:57.56] <Soni> (I mean it kinda is supported my MPNGPNG but not fully y'know what I mean?)

[01:01.05] <UberLambda> I thought it was because it didn't support deltas

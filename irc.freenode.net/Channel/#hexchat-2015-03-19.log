[02:36.47] <Briman> ohey, i just downloaded your JS hexchat plugin
[02:36.54] <Briman> fancy seeing you in the hexchat IRC channel.
[02:37.29] <TingPing> i saw
[02:37.58] <TingPing> Briman, btw i would never suggest that JS plugin over python
[02:38.04] <Briman> i can't stand python
[02:38.14] <Briman> and i'm not really planning on making any super complex plugin
[02:38.37] <Briman> and i can't get the Lua plugin to compile, so JS is the next best option :P
[02:38.39] <TingPing> id hope not since JS has no sort of built in functionality
[02:38.50] <Briman> has enough for what i need
[02:39.01] <Briman> and i don't mind coding my own if i need something else; i'm a C++ programmer
[02:39.39] <TingPing> Briman, finish migrating my JS plugin to mozjs 24 then, its built against an ancient release
[02:40.00] <Briman> possibly :P i'm not familiar with mozjs but i'm sure i could if i had the time
[02:40.36] <TingPing> i know nothing about JS or spidermonkey, i just wrote that out of boredom

[12:00.34] <DogPolice> lol.
[12:00.41] <DogPolice> Building spacecraft is friggin fun. :D
[12:00.49] <nitrix> Exploring space is.
[12:00.49] <lf94> Build real spacecraft
[12:00.50] <lf94> B)
[12:00.56] * DogPolice throws a Saturn V at lf94.
[12:01.10] * nitrix throws a SSTO to DogPolice.
[12:01.27] <DogPolice> nitrix: Aye.. 's why I'm doing all of this crazy stuff. By the way, have you seen this? ＋＋http://sirxemic.github.io/Interstellar/，，
[12:01.41] * wilornel_ throws an Orion at nitrix 
[12:01.49] <ecogiko> ""
[12:01.49] <ecogiko> Your graphics card does not seem to support WebGL.
[12:01.55] <DogPolice> Laaaame.
[12:02.02] <wilornel_> Yes, seen it!
[12:02.07] <wilornel_> Where is the black hole?

[12:02.27] <nitrix> DogPolice: Bookmarked, my laptop doesn't run that apprently. All pitch dark.
[12:02.30] <DogPolice> Go through it, and you'll find gargantua, with lensing just like the movie.
[12:02.38] * Bazzie (~0x2fab@68.235.130.115) Quit (Quit: you're in for wild ride, kid)
[12:02.47] <DogPolice> nitrix: Odd, mine does.. and I have an Intel GPU. e_e.
[12:02.55] <wilornel_> Ah my god, spawning new windows on me
[12:03.11] <DogPolice> But yeah! This thing is possible because of a new method of raytracing involving clusters of light, not single light rays.
[12:03.22] <DogPolice> It allows for lensing, and there's even a very digestable paper on it.
[12:03.37] <nitrix> That sounds amazing, can't wait to see it :)
[12:03.39] <DogPolice> :D

[12:04.44] <DogPolice> Night man! Thanks for talkin'! :)
[12:04.53] <Lencl> When you add a node to a binary tree.. how is the order supposed to be?
[12:04.55] * episage (~episage@94.0.222.152) has joined channel ##programming
[12:04.56] <Lencl> left to right?

[12:05.08] <nitrxgen> soldering 60~ 2mm pitched pins is a chore
[12:05.13] <ecogiko> DogPolice: did you study physics in a uni or did you learn it in your spare time?
[12:05.13] <wilornel_> smaller to the left and bigger to the right
[12:05.23] <Lencl> parent node > left child > right child > right parent > left right child > right right child..?
[12:05.32] <DogPolice> ecogiko: I started poking at it in my spare time.

[12:05.59] <Guest66212> DogPolice: do you know why the speed of light is constant?
[12:06.15] <wilornel_> Usually what you try to achieve is having nodes branch out into two trees which have the same amount of nodes each
[12:06.35] <wilornel_> this way you know that finding a node inside of the binary tree is always faster than a specific time t
[12:06.36] * episage_ (~episage@94.0.222.152) Quit (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[12:06.44] * ChanServ sets mode +o DogPolice for ##programming
[12:06.49] <Serpentine_> It really depends on the type of binary tree you would like to create
[12:06.51] <@DogPolice> Dernit..
[12:06.59] * muttstuffle (~muttstuff@pool-173-72-156-137.clppva.fios.verizon.net) has joined channel ##programming
[12:07.01] <wilornel_> Guest66212, DogPolice: I think it varies depending of location. If we go somewhere else very far, it would be a bit different
[12:07.12] * DogPolice sets mode -b *!*@*190.190.32.227$##programming-ops for ##programming
[12:07.13] * DogPolice sets mode -o DogPolice for ##programming
[12:07.19] <Serpentine_> For example, skew heaps are bizarrely unordered and tend to have more nodes towards the left
[12:07.22] * LogUse (~LogUse@190.190.32.227) has joined channel ##programming
[12:07.27] <DogPolice> There ya go. sorry LogUse!
[12:07.58] <Serpentine_> Whereas the more conventional binary search tree has a stricter ordering on the nodes

[12:08.51] <Guest66212> wilornel_: i'm pretty sure light travels at every speed, but can only be observed traveling at the speed of light relative to the observer
[12:08.58] * episage_ (~episage@94.0.222.152) has joined channel ##programming
[12:09.47] <DogPolice> Guest66212: The speed of light is only important because it's the speed (or propagation) of packets (or particles) with no mass (i.e no interaction with the higgs field).
[12:10.08] <Lencl> wilornel_ so if there is a subtree with 1 parent node and 2 child nodes.. and another subtree on the right with 1 parent node and 1 child.. I add to the right one as a new child?
[12:10.19] * themanhimself (~themanhim@2601:8:600:816:e1b8:182b:3f35:dc21) Quit (Quit: Leaving...)
[12:10.29] <DogPolice> The speed of light, in my framework, then becomes relative ("slowed") to the medium that gravitation can bend.
[12:11.01] <Lencl> wilornel_ also some people are suggesting that everything greater than the root will go on right side of subtree.. and everything left goes on left side of subtree
[12:11.01] <DogPolice> Without the medium, I don't know if it'd be a constant or an infinity.

[12:11.23] * episage (~episage@94.0.222.152) Quit (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[12:11.23] <Guest66212> DogPolice: i'm pretty sure instead of having mass, photons have energy observable angle
[12:11.47] <Guest66212> DogPolice: like the energy of the photon is evenly distributed at every frame of reference
[12:11.48] --hydri-- logged in with account (hydri)
[12:11.56] <Guest66212> or something like that
[12:12.14] * genbattle (~genbattle@115-188-151-169.jetstream.xtra.co.nz) Quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[12:12.25] <DogPolice> Guest66212: Yeah. And that energy interacts with the medium. It just so happens in ideal conditions (i.e extremely low energy regions of this medium we call "space"), the speed of light is the value we get normally.
[12:12.43] <DogPolice> So it's really just the speed of "massless particles" zipping through the medium.
[12:12.58] <DogPolice> Remove the medium and it's like trying to measure the speed of sound without air.

[12:13.30] * episage (~episage@94.0.222.152) has joined channel ##programming
[12:14.12] <Guest66212> the way i imagine it, when you change your speed, you change the part of the photon that is observable
[12:15.15] <Guest66212> the part of it that is angled at the speed of light
[12:15.18] <DogPolice> There was an article on phys.org about a year or two ago demonstrating that the phantom-like "vacuum energy" could, very carefully, introduce kinks in the speed of light.

[12:15.42] * episage_ (~episage@94.0.222.152) has joined channel ##programming
[12:16.00] <DogPolice> These findings correspond to my theory of the medium: if it can vary, then something must be affecting it,
[12:16.03] <DogPolice> And causing the variation.
[12:16.12] <DogPolice> Annnnnd.. here's the article: ＋＋http://phys.org/news/2013-03-ephemeral-vacuum-particles-speed-of-light-fluctuations.html，，

[12:17.59] * episage (~episage@94.0.222.152) has joined channel ##programming
[12:18.09] <DogPolice> I'm not saying that high speeds don't produce this effect (only applied to massless particles). What I am saying is that the rate that these things happen is relative to something else.
[12:19.19] <Guest66212> how do physicists seperate the effects of time dilation from the speed of light?
[12:19.30] <DogPolice> Well, they don't..
[12:20.11] <DogPolice> Take the water planet from Interstellar with a crazy high dilation factor.
[12:20.14] * episage_ (~episage@94.0.222.152) Quit (Ping timeout: 255 seconds)
[12:20.24] <DogPolice> If you look at it, you're not looking at what's happenig on the surface currently.
[12:20.35] <DogPolice> That light took a looong time to reach you.

[12:23.05] <Rad-> bst_insert(&bst_tree,test[i]);
[12:23.20] <Rad-> other than the fact that i didn't copy my entire declaration, how come i can't edit my tree
[12:23.30] <Guest66212> when you have two clocks that are synchronized at exactally the same point in space, and then one travels 1 light year away, how would a physicsist be able to determine how long it takes light from clock A to reach clock B considering that the two clocks will have desynchronized by 1 light year?
[12:23.51] * genbattle (~genbattle@115-188-151-169.jetstream.xtra.co.nz) has joined channel ##programming
[12:24.08] <Guest66212> in other words, the clock that moved 1 light year away will have experienced 1 light year of time as space
[12:24.16] * genbattle (~genbattle@115-188-151-169.jetstream.xtra.co.nz) Quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[12:24.28] <DogPolice> Guest66212: But if they share a dilation factor, they will be the same.
[12:24.42] <DogPolice> (That is, if they're in a vacuum.)
[12:24.47] <Guest66212> 1 light year of it's experience of time will have translated into spatial movement relative to clock A
[12:24.58] * justanotheruser is now known as FlechetteTP
[12:25.04] * genbattle (~genbattle@115-188-151-169.jetstream.xtra.co.nz) has joined channel ##programming
[12:25.18] <DogPolice> Right, and you'll view the light coming off of the clock.
[12:25.19] * genbattle (~genbattle@115-188-151-169.jetstream.xtra.co.nz) Quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[12:25.30] * FlechetteTP is now known as justanotheruser
[12:25.30] <DogPolice> But both clocks will be working with the same time, still.
[12:25.48] <DogPolice> If you can observe both clocks on both sides of that light year of distance, you'll find that they were in sync (assuming a vacuum.)
[12:25.57] <DogPolice> Rad-: C++/
[12:25.58] <DogPolice> *?
[12:26.05] <Guest66212> what i'm trying to say is, what was time for one of the clocks has become space for the other
[12:26.38] <DogPolice> Guest66212: Replace "clocks" with "observers", and it becomes apparent. If I go one lightyear away and wave my hand at you, it'll take you a year to see that result.
[12:26.42] <Rad-> DogPolice: C
[12:26.54] * sctskw (~sctskw@c-50-152-30-192.hsd1.co.comcast.net) Quit (Remote host closed the connection)
[12:27.14] <DogPolice> Rad-: bst_insert takes a pointer to a struct t_node right?
[12:27.21] <Rad-> i yeah
[12:27.38] <DogPolice> So why are you taking the address of bst_tree when it's already a pointer? Or are you taking a pointer to a pointer?
[12:27.43] <Rad-> i'm pretty sure my problem is pointers because i'm trying to display the tree and it says it's empty.
[12:27.48] <Rad-> er sorry i've gone through a few edits
[12:27.53] <Rad-> original was something like this
[12:28.02] <DogPolice> Paste your actual code into somethin' like ideone.com.
[12:28.28] <Guest66212> DogPolice: but my point is that the clock that traveled 1 light year away will have experienced 1 light year more time than you
[12:28.38] <DogPolice> Guest66212: No, you'll still experience the same time.
[12:28.55] <DogPolice> Guest66212: Again, if you can travel to each point at the same time, you'd see that both clocks are in sync.
[12:29.11] <DogPolice> The clock desynchronization happens if you introduce a dilation factor, which isn't present here due to us assuming a vacuum.
[12:30.05] --HenriettaSalt-- logged in with account (HenriettaSalt)
[12:30.12] <Guest66212> DogPolice: time dilation is the result of experiencing time in the spatial dimensions relative to another observer
[12:30.14] --astroo--- logged in with account (astroo-)
[12:30.16] <DogPolice> No.
[12:30.22] <DogPolice> Time dilation is the result of gravitation deforming spacetime.
[12:30.34] <DogPolice> No gravity, no dilation, no shift.
[12:30.46] <DogPolice> (this is in general relativity).

[12:38.28] <DogPolice> You have pointers to things, but as far as you know, those pointers are pointing to garbage. Just because this code worked doesn't mean it's correct.
[12:38.39] <DogPolice> Also, it really isn't.. you have a pointer that you're modifying.
[12:38.57] <DogPolice> Why do you need hello2 to modify hello?
[12:39.19] <DogPolice> You need to point your pointers to memory that exists, then pass them around.
[12:39.29] <DogPolice> Else things will get hairy.

[12:41.47] <Rad-> I'm just trying to figure out what i'm doing wrong with pointers
[12:41.48] <blizzy> I would of not said it was homework.
[12:41.50] <Rad-> but it looks like...nothing
[12:42.04] <Rad-> that's why i posted a mockup not the actual code =P
[12:42.05] <blizzy> Rad-, I would give you a few pointers, but I don't know C.
[12:42.06] <DogPolice> blizzy: He's honest. That's a good thing to be. :)
[12:42.22] <Rad-> what i don't understand is why the mockup works but my code doesn't
[12:42.24] <Rad-> prolly something else
[12:42.25] <Rad-> meh
[12:42.37] <DogPolice> Rad-: Your mockup doesn't work because your pointer in "main" is..
[12:42.41] <DogPolice> Not pointing to anything.
[12:42.49] <DogPolice> Valgrind would have a fit with that.
[12:42.59] <Rad-> well in mockup
[12:43.07] <Rad-> well in real code* it points to null

[12:43.14] <DogPolice> Yeah, and that's why it's not working.
[12:43.15] <blizzy> honesty is great.
[12:43.18] <DogPolice> You need to allocate memory for it.
[12:43.22] <Guest66212> DogPolice: i thought the theory was that if you could travel twards another object purely in the time dimension, you would experience the entire progression as time where as the other object would experience none

[12:43.41] <Rad-> if it's not

[12:55.49] <DogPolice> There's a reason why Planck Time and Planck Length have such an intimate relationship. :)

[01:29.29] <rem500> as computer processing power increases is it possible that javascript will be obsolete and websites will use a better language to do graphics and popups and stuff?
[01:29.34] <Myrl> DogPolice: Meh, too hard to work on a 74LSxx.
[01:29.51] <DogPolice> Myrl: No..?
[01:29.58] <DogPolice> Myrl: The stack is just an area of memory..?
[01:30.02] <wilornel_> rem500: I think improvements in processors are currently being made in parallelization
[01:30.02] <Serpentine_> rem500: As computer processing power increases, faster and older languages become obsolete
[01:30.06] <Myrl> DogPolice: cumulative operations I mean.
[01:30.08] <DogPolice> rem500: We'll have to wait and see.
[01:30.10] <wilornel_> And graphics do make use of that
[01:30.16] <wilornel_> So I think that the answer if yes
[01:30.16] <Serpentine_> rem500: Newer and much slower languages will counteract the effects of Moore's law
[01:30.20] <DogPolice> Myrl: ..No? You don't do that, the programmer does.
[01:30.26] <_X_C_V_B_> Write the expression for the volume of a thick crust pizza with height "a" and radius "z".
[01:30.31] <wilornel_> But it all depends on how the big companies pull it out
[01:30.40] <DogPolice> _X_C_V_B_: Model it as a torus.
[01:30.46] <Myrl> DogPolice: Ah. I thought what you were trying to say was optimizing by looking at the instruction pattern.
[01:30.49] <rem500> it seems the speed of the language doesn't mean much, how fast you can develop something new is much more important right
[01:30.52] <DogPolice> Myrl: Nope.

[01:31.07] <DogPolice> rem500: The consistency of the language and its target domain matters.
[01:31.08] <Serpentine_> rem500: It's definitely important if your goal is to push out products at a faster rate
[01:31.12] <DogPolice> rem500: Everything else is just noise.
[01:31.13] <_X_C_V_B_> pi*z*z*a
[01:31.30] <DogPolice> _X_C_V_B_: I... cannot argue with that.
[01:31.34] <Myrl> DogPolice: Like if you have a read memory and bitmask operation right next to each other, the underlying hardware will only read according to the bitmask.
[01:31.35] <Serpentine_> _X_C_V_B_: Oh my, that's ingenious!

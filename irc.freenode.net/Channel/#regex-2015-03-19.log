[02:39.04] <regex101-7955> Hi can someone help me with matching <end of module> but not <endoftag>
[02:39.08] <regex101-7955> what i want is to get all tags with spaces
[02:39.15] <regex101-7955> but not the tags who doesnt
[02:39.19] <regex101-7955> this is what i've tried
[02:39.22] <regex101-7955> <(?=\s+)>
[02:39.25] <musca> regex101-7955:  why do you apply regex on tags?   Not doing so is the first item of the FAQ.
[02:39.26] <regex101-7955> here's some sample data
[02:39.33] <regex101-7955> <end of module>  <endofmodule>
[02:40.57] * stylo (~stylo@unaffiliated/innocentus) Quit (Ping timeout: 246 seconds)
[02:41.08] <regex101-7955> musca: because i want to clean the xml response of a webservice
[02:41.52] <Nebulam> THe problem is they might have < that aren't tags but you can try <[^>]*\s+[^>]*>
[02:42.02] <musca> as you want, but ... meh.   ＋＋https://regex101.com/r/uD4xQ9/1，，
[02:42.22] <Nebulam> lol exactly the same
[02:42.34] <musca> yes, i like that :)
[02:42.38] <Nebulam> :)
[02:43.30] <regex101-7955> Well those sample data is from a webservice xml response
[02:43.41] <regex101-7955> xml's are supposed to be well formed
[02:43.44] * ToAruShiroiNeko (~White_Cat@wikimedia/ToAruShiroiNeko) Quit (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[02:43.55] <Nebulam> yeah but they could have escaped < and >'s
[02:43.56] <regex101-7955> but in the response there's a html tag and an html tag can contain space
[02:44.16] * RWOverdijk (~RWOverdij@87.213.98.98) Quit (Ping timeout: 264 seconds)
[02:44.36] <regex101-7955> is it possible for me to get the < and > also?
[02:44.45] <regex101-7955> what ill do is not really remove it but encode it
[02:44.50] <regex101-7955> to its html encoded value
[02:44.52] <Nebulam> just put the parenthesis around the whole thing
[02:46.24] <regex101-7955> thanks for the help! though i didn't fully understand the regex, are resource you could suggest for me to get a good grasp of regex?

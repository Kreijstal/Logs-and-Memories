[12:37.11] <p0a> Jaood: yes, the more restricted substatement wins
[12:37.32] <p0a> Jaood: continuous & uniformly continuous = uniformly continuous
[12:37.39] <int-e> Ozera: as an additive group, 12Z is isomorphic to Z. But the quotient Z/12Z equates a,b in Z if a - b is an element of 12Z, that is, if they are equal modulo 12.
[12:38.22] * shikhin_ is now known as shikhin

[12:40.04] <Jaood> hmm
[12:40.22] * SomeT (~SomeT@cpc3-leic16-2-0-cust382.8-1.cable.virginm.net) Quit ()
[12:40.33] <Ozera> int-e, why are the elements of 3Z/12Z this: {0,2,6,9} ?
[12:41.12] <Janital>  anyone aware of a practical example in the real-world where knowing gcd of two numbers is really crucial?  but a nice example, not sth like  " one needs to know what is a number of ppl such that if we choose to split two quantities for that number of ppl, each ppl will receive integer money "
[12:42.42] <Jaood> raskol: so by your last statement you mean something like like (x < 4) & (x < 6) would be  (x < 4) ?
[12:43.00] <metallic> Janital, Diofantic equations
[12:43.16] <int-e> Ozera: you made a typo, right?
[12:43.23] <Jaood> p0a: wouldn't continous be more restricted than uniformly continous?
[12:43.26] * petersr (~PeterSR@87-58-53-250-static.dk.customer.tdc.net) has joined channel ##math
[12:43.31] <Janital> diofantic equation is not a practical example in the real world, it is an abstract formula which might appear in the real-world
[12:43.40] <raskol> Jaood: yes, I affirmed your statement with a negative, sorry if that was confusing
[12:43.53] <Ozera> int-e, yes. A 3 instead of a 2
[12:43.53] <p0a> Jaood: no, why?
[12:44.12] * agjacome (~agjacome@151.175.20.95.dynamic.jazztel.es) Quit (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[12:44.18] <metallic> Janital, lol maybe you do not know as much as you think the "real world"
[12:44.25] * rfk (~fgk@li667-207.members.linode.com) Quit (Quit: leaving)
[12:44.30] <metallic> Janital, gcd is also useful for Bezout identities
[12:44.49] <int-e> Ozera: the elements of 3Z are {0,3,-3,6,-6,9,-9,...}; 3Z/12Z equates any two of those if they are equal modulo 12. { 0, 3, 6, 9 } happens to cover every residue class modulo 12 whose elements are divisible by 3 (i.e. elements of 3Z).
[12:44.52] <Janital> real-world problems in highschool
[12:44.57] <Janital> have you heard about those metallic
[12:45.02] <Janital> im looking for those
[12:45.05] <Janital> Jane had a restaurant ..
[12:45.06] <Janital> etc
[12:45.09] <metallic> aaaah highschool problems are shit
[12:45.11] <metallic> XD
[12:45.13] <Janital> i want shit
[12:45.17] <metallic> lol
[12:45.19] <Jaood> p0a: does the words continous and uniform has meaning in this context?
[12:45.23] <Ozera> int-e, ah okay
[12:45.27] <Jaood> *have
[12:45.58] * rebs (~rebs@cpe-69-204-33-166.buffalo.res.rr.com) has joined channel ##math
[12:45.59] <p0a> Jaood: forget about it. Try this: I'm a little happy AND I'm very happy. Therefore I'm very happy
[12:46.11] <metallic> Janital, all I can think of is arithmetic concepts like modular rings... :( Sorry, I left highschool much time ago
[12:46.18] <p0a> Jaood: much happiness is more to ask than little happiness
[12:46.27] <p0a> Jaood: therefore more happiness is more restrictive
[12:46.48] <rebs> if i see an existential operator followed by an '!', should i read that is there doesnt exist, or as  there exists a unique
[12:46.56] <Janital> so apparently there isnt a easy to grasp application of gcd that kids can learn
[12:46.56] <p0a> rebs: unique I believe
[12:47.00] <Janital> for lcm there is
[12:47.03] <Ozera> To check if Q[x]/(x^2 - x - 6) is a field, I have to check if x^2 - x - 6 is reducible in Q right? I know how to check reducibility, but how do I check it for Q?
[12:47.11] <rebs> ok ty p0a
[12:47.15] * _kmh_ (~kilian@p5B35A48F.dip0.t-ipconnect.de) Quit (Quit: Leaving)
[12:47.29] <metallic> But for the record, highschool problems cannot be "real-world alike" because if they were, highschool students would not be able to handle them
[12:47.32] <p0a> Janital: usually we put the prime divisors of n and m in two bins and show the kids that the product of those "in common" are the gcd
[12:47.38] <Jaood> p0a: oh got it
[12:47.45] <Ozera> Janital, what? Just tell them what it is and they will be like "oh, okay why didn't you just tell me that instead of a fucking 'real life application story'
[12:47.48] <Jaood> ty guys
[12:48.03] <int-e> Ozera: it's a quadratic, so you can simply find its roots; if they are rational, then the polynomial is reducible in Q.
[12:48.33] * masenn (328e8a2c@gateway/web/freenode/ip.50.142.138.44) has joined channel ##math

[12:49.21] * tmager (~Thunderbi@resnet-130-64-128-218.medford.tufts.edu) Quit (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[12:49.23] <Ozera> int-e, well, that polynomial reduces to (x-3)(x+2) and -3,2 are rational so it is not reducible over Q. Hence Q[x]/(x^2 - x - 6) is not a field
[12:49.28] <int-e> Ozera: you can also use the rational roots theorem here.
[12:49.34] <int-e> Ozera: right
[12:49.35] <jollyjoe> hey there. is there a deep connection between formal systems and turing machines? i've read a bit about how formal systems work and have programmed before and it feels like there's a connection there.
[12:50.02] <Ozera> Ah bugger, I forgot the rrt. I don't know how since it was pounded into my head for forever
[12:50.04] <metallic> jollyjoe, do you mean formal LANGUAGES?
[12:50.08] <masenn> [~masenn@unaffiliated/masenn] has quit [Ping timeout: 3.14159265358979323846 seconds]
[12:50.10] <Ozera> also eisenstien criterion oh noo

[12:51.07] * kmels (~kmels@186.151.61.248) Quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[12:51.28] <int-e> Ozera: note that finding roots is not enough for degrees larger than 3. then you need proper irreducibility criteria (like Eisenstein's)
[12:52.21] <jollyjoe> metallic: you mean both are classes of formal languages?
[12:53.03] <metallic> jollyjoe, I know what a Turing machine is, but I have no idea what a "formal system" is, that's why I asked you whether you meant "formal languages"
[12:53.06] <int-e> Ozera: For example, x^4+4 has no rational roots, but x^4+4 = (x^2 + 2)^2 - (2x)^2 = (x^2 - 2x + 2) (x^2 + 2x + 2).
[12:53.23] <Ozera> :o !

[12:53.49] * p0a (9334974c@gateway/web/freenode/ip.147.52.151.76) Quit ()
[12:53.50] <jollyjoe> metallic: that's a surprising statement. ＋＋http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_system，，
[12:54.06] * et09 (~mike@unaffiliated/endolphin) has joined channel ##math

[12:54.43] * d_k (~dk@cpc68034-cmbg14-2-0-cust100.5-4.cable.virginm.net) has joined channel ##math
[12:55.23] <Ozera> int-e, what about instead of Q, we have Z_5 ? The next exercise is to find all c  \in Z_5 s.t. Z_5[x] / <x^3 + cx^2 + 1> is a field. So we need to find c s.t. x^3 + cx^2 + 1 is irreducible.
[12:55.35] * tjger (~tjger@46.128.43.80.dynamic.cablesurf.de) has joined channel ##math
[12:55.36] <jollyjoe> metallic: basically, a formal system is a formal language with deductions (e.g., mathematics)
[12:55.37] <Ozera> We can't use Eisenstiens because that is for Q only
[12:55.38] <metallic> jollyjoe, so a formal system is a formal language with a logic, right?
[12:55.46] <jollyjoe> yes
[12:55.49] <Ozera> oh wait, we still can
[12:56.02] <Ozera> if we show irreducible for Q we show it for Z
[12:56.09] <int-e> Ozera: right, but the polynomial is cubic; any factorization has a linear factor, so finding roots is still sufficient.
[12:56.27] <Ozera> int-e, i'm going to have to check c=1,2,3,4,5 :/ oh well
[12:56.37] <Ozera> er, no 5
[12:56.42] <metallic> jollyjoe, in fact Turing machine can be used to see whether a theory (formal system) is decidable or not
[12:56.49] <Ozera> 0 instead
[12:57.10] <metallic> that is a very interesting field, though pretty complicated
[12:57.18] * jailbot (~textual@50.247.131.163) Quit (Ping timeout: 244 seconds)
[12:57.40] <jollyjoe> metallic: yeah, i've read about undecidable problems
[12:57.48] <jollyjoe> i'm just now learning about incompleteness and such
[12:57.49] <int-e> Ozera: There may be a trick, but I don't see it.
[12:57.55] <jollyjoe> so it's still a mistery to me
[12:57.58] * wagonboi (~wagonboi@pool-173-51-93-143.lsanca.fios.verizon.net) Quit (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[12:58.10] * dj_pi (~dj@c-107-5-228-80.hsd1.mi.comcast.net) Quit (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[12:58.14] <Janital> metallic no, a formal system is a formal language plus rules of inference ( ways to go from "words" in the language to another words )
[12:58.20] <Janital> those rules of inference might be logical ones or not
[12:58.32] * Travisty (~anonymous@c-73-183-50-181.hsd1.pa.comcast.net) has joined channel ##math
[12:58.46] <jollyjoe> depends on how you define "logical"
[12:58.50] <metallic> oh dude, then you know more than I do, I want to take a subject on ZF set theory :)
[12:58.55] <Janital> no, logical is well defined as in classical logic
[12:58.59] * Tarap (~bgg@roa76-6-82-238-233-207.fbx.proxad.net) has joined channel ##math
[12:59.00] <Janital> or modular logic
[12:59.02] <Janital> or quantum logic
[12:59.05] <Janital> its not a ambiguous term
[12:59.08] * Macuser (~textual@unaffiliated/macuser) Quit (Quit: My MacBook Pro has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[12:59.22] * zz_ezio is now known as ezio
[12:59.25] <Janital> but the allowed operations in a turing machine are not logic
[12:59.26] * oalvarez (~alvarezp@pdpc/supporter/active/alvarezp) Quit (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[12:59.31] <Janital> that is for sure
[12:59.35] <Janital> the rules of inference*
[12:59.38] <jollyjoe> i'd be surprised if people didn't use the word "logic" for something that doesn't apply in the real world
[12:59.45] * oriig (~oriig@78-83-49-71.spectrumnet.bg) Quit (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[12:59.55] * et09 (~mike@unaffiliated/endolphin) Quit (Quit: leaving)
[01:00.10] <int-e> Ozera: ah, at least you can turn it around: for each x=0,+-1,+-2, compute which c (if any) makes the polynomial zero.
[01:00.32] <metallic> jollyjoe, so you have studied Gödel theorems?
[01:01.01] <jollyjoe> i know what they say but i'm still reading on godel numbers
[01:01.11] * balance (~balance@55.155.62.188.dynamic.wline.res.cust.swisscom.ch) Quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[01:01.14] <jollyjoe> so i'm not yet knowledgeable about the proofs
[01:01.14] * masenn (328e8a2c@gateway/web/freenode/ip.50.142.138.44) Quit (Quit: Page closed)
[01:01.34] * br0d1n (~mikaj@173-171-162-247.res.bhn.net) has joined channel ##math
[01:01.39] <Ozera> int-e, so to be irreducible in Z_5, the roots can't be integers? Do they also have be some number in Z_5?
[01:01.56] <metallic> me either, I just know what they say, also I know there is a connection between Turing machines and Gödel numbers, but I didn't exploit that :/
[01:02.21] * agjacome (~agjacome@182.171.20.95.dynamic.jazztel.es) has joined channel ##math
[01:02.24] <jollyjoe> well undecidability in the turing sense was also proved with godel numbers
[01:02.28] <int-e> Ozera: It's a field, so you can consider monic factors (x-a). If (x-a) divides x^3 + cx^2 + 1 then a is a root of x^3 + cx^2 + 1.
[01:02.41] * mimer (~Mimer@unaffiliated/mimer) Quit (Quit: L�mnar)
[01:03.16] <metallic> That is an interesting topic, how the logic evolved until what it is today
[01:03.21] <int-e> Ozera: (starting with the observation that if the polynomial is reducible then it has a linear factor. That's where the (x-a) comes from.)
[01:03.28] * Orpheon (~Orpheon@80-219-40-81.dclient.hispeed.ch) Quit (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[01:03.58] <int-e> Ozera: in any case, yes, you'll be finding roots over Z_5
[01:03.59] <jollyjoe> metallic: yeah, the foundations seem very interesting
[01:04.05] * notalanturing (~agon@2001:41b8:83f:1000::ffff:e9a) Quit (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)

[01:04.29] * agjacome_ (~agjacome@251.162.20.95.dynamic.jazztel.es) has joined channel ##math
[01:04.40] <int-e> Ozera: x^2+1 is irreducible in Q, but equal to (x-2)(x+2) in Z_5, hence reducible.
[01:04.43] <Ozera> int-e, right, but for our previous example of Q[x]/<x^2 - x - 6>, we had the condition that the roots had to be rational in order for the polynomial to be reducible in Q.
[01:05.06] * topmytopology (4a085a3c@gateway/web/cgi-irc/kiwiirc.com/ip.74.8.90.60) has joined channel ##math
[01:05.08] <int-e> Ozera: and indeed 2^2+1 = 5 = 0 (mod 5).
[01:05.32] <Ozera> mm
[01:06.34] <Ozera> int-e, what if the polynomail had roots which were fractions?

[01:08.29] <int-e> Ozera: In Q?
[01:08.35] <meoblast001> i'm a bit confused on something here in group theory... i can't see how it's possible to prove that there cannot be two elements of order 2 in a group.... i can even think of a counterexample... Z_{1} = { 0, 1} under addition... 0 + 0 = 0, 1 + 1 = 0...
[01:08.42] <meoblast001> is my logic off or something?
[01:08.51] * agjacome_ (~agjacome@251.162.20.95.dynamic.jazztel.es) Quit (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[01:08.51] <Ozera> int-e, sorry, for Z_5
[01:08.54] * Mmango (~user@rrcs-98-100-153-182.central.biz.rr.com) has joined channel ##math
[01:09.02] <Ozera> or if they were complex roots
[01:09.08] <int-e> Ozera: Z_5 is a field, you don't need fractions.

[01:09.18] * cbot` (~FS@ool-2f12e4fc.dyn.optonline.net) has joined channel ##math
[01:09.28] <tensorpudding> meoblast001: In which group? There are lots of groups with more than one unique element of order 2 in it.
[01:09.33] <Ozera> int-e, but what if our polynomial had non-integer roots?
[01:09.51] <meoblast001> tensorpudding: well. what i'm trying to prove is that no group can have exactly two elements of order 2
[01:09.53] <int-e> Ozera: "
[01:10.01] <int-e> Ozera: "integer" is not applicable here, really.
[01:10.04] * timlyg (~timlyg@ool-45716958.dyn.optonline.net) Quit (Quit: leaving)
[01:10.08] <meoblast001> isn't the group i presented a counter example?
[01:10.13] * Ozera squints
[01:10.16] <meoblast001> it's a group containing two elements where both have order 2
[01:10.45] <int-e> Ozera: The polynomial either has roots in Z_5, or not. But in the latter case the roots won't be fractions; they'll be more complicated (square roots, say).
[01:10.59] * metallic at first read "Ozera squirts"
[01:11.19] <tensorpudding> meoblast001: The identity can't count as an element of order 2.
[01:11.29] <int-e> Ozera: For example 2x - 1 has x=3 as a root in Z_5.
[01:11.39] <int-e> Ozera: not 1/2.

[01:21.48] <bluesnow> Hi, I'm kind of confused about a math model that's used in my linguistics textbook
[01:22.20] <bluesnow> It's a bigram model where the probability of a word occuring next in a sequence is modeled as a conditional probability on the previous word
[01:22.49] <bluesnow> And then the prob of an entire sequence of words is P(w_1..n) = product of the sequence from k=1 to n of P(w_k|w_k-1)
[01:23.07] * linear4 (L@unaffiliated/lynear) Quit (Ping timeout: 246 seconds)
[01:23.22] <bluesnow> My textbook then says we need to add a special symbol <s> at the beginning to give the bigram context of the first word, and it also says we need to add a special end-symbol to make the bigram grammar a true probability distribution
[01:23.37] <bluesnow> "Without an end-symbol, the sentece probabilities for all sentences of a given length would sum to one.."
[01:23.50] <bluesnow> The requirement for the end-symbol is what I'm confused about
[01:24.10] <bluesnow> I don't see why the sentence probabilities for all sentences of a given length would sum to 1 otherwise, and I don't see how the end symbol fixes it
[01:24.23] <raskol> bluesnow: if you have an end symbol you might end the sentence before the given length

[01:33.07] <Dann20> Let e > 0.  |Xn + Yn - (L-M)| < e

[01:33.52] <metallic> good

[01:36.31] * lifenoodles (~lifenoodl@109.255.237.77) has joined channel ##math

[07:23.11] <Koen_> django_: if you have a formula to calculate the determinant using the coefficients of the matrix, it should be quite easy to convince yourself that if one entire row is full of zeroes, the determinant is 0

[07:35.16] * _Atom_ (~jawat@cpe-72-182-59-185.austin.res.rr.com) has joined channel ##math
[07:35.17] <Koen_> ie if you have A = [[a1, a2, a3], [b1, b2, b3], [c1, c2, c3]] you can write det(A) = a1 det([[b2, b3], [c2, c3]]) - b1 det([[a2, a3], [c2, c3]]) + c1 det([[a2, a3], [b2, b3]])
[07:35.44] <Koen_> (note that the signs alternate)
[07:35.58] <Koen_> you can do this with any column or row, here I did it with the first column
[07:36.23] <Koen_> the smaller matrices are the matrices you get by "barring out" the line and column of the coefficient you're considering
[07:36.52] <Koen_> so if the first column was 0, 1, 0 for instance
[07:37.05] <Koen_> ie a1=0, c1=0, b1=1
[07:37.38] <Koen_> then this simplifies to det(A) = -b1 det([[a2, a3], [c2, c3]])
[07:37.38] <django_> Koen_ if you want the cofactor matrix
[07:37.43] <django_> how is it defined?

[11:50.55] <exaction> didn't we have a discussion about this the other day?
[11:51.06] <Litt> okay so A is a subset of A, but A is NOT a proper subset of A ?
[11:51.19] <cads> Litt: A C_ B typically means "A is a subset of B that might equal B" (subset),  while  A C B means "A is a subset of be not equal to B" (proper subset)
[11:51.34] <cads> where C_ is the subset/equality symbol
[11:51.52] <Litt> oh so i got it the other way round
[11:51.57] <Litt> okay sweet thanks a lot

[11:52.20] <cads> Litt: that's right
[11:53.08] <zHafydd> \subseteq always denotes "possibly improper subset", while \subset sometimes denotes "proper subset", but is commonly used for any kind of subset. So really, if you want to be clear, use either \subseteq or \subsetneq. Where \subseteq is ＋＋http://upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/d/6/1d692925920a6f5ff7d9b834b166debc.png,，， \subsetneq is ＋＋http://upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/0/d/50de602089f264acf40e7c74aa0a8c49.png,，， and \subset looks like "C".

[11:54.37] <cads> authors that use the nonstandard sense of  C will typically tell you, or are presenting math that's advanced enough they expect you to figure it out :)

[11:55.22] <shij020l> well, we know that the universe is no older than 10^17 seconds and physicists agree there are no more than 10^82 particles in the universe, assuming that the maximum number of interactions each particle has is 10^20 per second then the absolute probability limit is 1 chance in 10^119, ignoring the less than 1 in 10^50 impossibility accepted by statisticians

[11:56.40] <cads> Dann20: look at a reference for some proofs by contradiction
[11:57.33] <Dann20> Basis right though?

[11:57.56] <Dann20> Why do i even need the -x part
[11:57.59] <cads> I would close the proof by presenting the nature of the contradiction, and then stating the fact that we proved
[11:58.28] <cads> Dann20: can you answer that question for me?
[11:58.35] <cads> simplify

[11:58.57] <Dann20> I don't think i need the -Xn
[11:59.09] <spudzee1111> I have a question about this equation: e^(ix) = cosx + isinx
[11:59.12] <cads> (x+y) - x = y
[11:59.30] <cads> since by assumption, (x+y) and x are convergent, so is y
[11:59.40] <spudzee1111> why da hell does it work?

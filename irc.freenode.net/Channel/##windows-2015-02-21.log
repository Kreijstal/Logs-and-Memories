[06:53.30] <windows-newbie> Hello, I just recently installed a super old windows xp pro (sp1) on a friends computer after formatting, and it has no drivers :S. I'm trying to get connected to the net but have some barriers: I'm trying to install ethernet drivers to connect via direct [dsl] but the USB storage devices im trying to use to transfer the drivers is not seen - is there anything I can do short of burning a disc ? (we have none here)|

[07:26.07] <guest342156743> for visual studios i know the backend c/c++ compiler is cl , linker is LINK  for C# we have csc compiler ,  vbc.exe for visual basic and not sure of the top of my head what the j,j++,j#,F# compilers/linkers are named but don't currently care about those. My questions are is vbc /platform anycpu is that the equivalent of it compiling to byte code CLR .net machine byte code  as opposed to the old native machine code x86,x64,ar

[07:28.21] <guest342156743> which i think is /Platform anycpu
[07:28.54] <guest342156743> as opposed to /Platform x86 which would be native machine code :)

[07:34.45] <Entalyan> Varrick: Good looking is pretty subjective. I like Foobar2000, which is very barebones by default, but can be extended with lots of modules and skins
[07:35.28] <Varrick> Entalyan: Can it play FLACs?
[07:35.38] <Entalyan> Varrick: Yes
[07:35.50] <Entalyan> Varrick: Windows 10 will be natively compatible with them :)
[07:35.51] <guest342156743> so i am curious  though for c/c++ .net compiling i know by default it compiles with some cl switch to allow it to compile to .net bytecode instead of the orignal native machine language anybody know the equivalent to /platform anycpu but for the c/c++ language in visual studios i am thinking it is /clr and if i don't uses this switch the compiler will compile to native machine code. Is this correct
[07:36.13] <Varrick> Entalyan: I hope, my friend.
[07:36.17] <Entalyan> c/c++ compile to machine code, c# doesn't

[07:36.34] * MrAlexanB (~MrAlexand@43.232.251.212.customer.cdi.no) has joined channel ##windows
[07:36.45] <Entalyan> Also, try the ##csharp channel for .NET compiling related questions
[07:38.18] <guest342156743> i thought in visual studio's all the languages by default compile to the clr runtime bytecode unless specifically shutting off a switch on the compiler i know for  csc , vbc it is /platform that determines weather it is bytecode or machine code compiled
[07:38.54] <sepeck>  ##windows-coding, #win32 , ##WinJS or #winapi, or a channel specific to your programming language.  <-- may gt more coding oriented answers in those channels
[07:39.57] <guest342156743> but for c/c++ i always used more as machine compiled but with new visual studio i would imagine it is by default the bytecode which i rather emmit the machine code may /clr switch being omitted would change it to machine code
[07:40.02] <Entalyan> Also, check ＋＋https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/8ck8e1y2.aspx，，
[07:40.44] <Entalyan> .NET NEVER compiles to machinecode, always to IL for the CLR. C and C++ do compile to machine code.
[07:41.39] <guest342156743> not in visual studios i thought by default all languages compile to the IL  byte code that the VM runs

[07:43.31] * Dynamit (~Mohamed@84-55-71-67.customers.ownit.se) has joined channel ##windows
[07:43.58] <guest342156743> if i am wrong then for c/c++ language i can you tell them to emit  IL or native machine code there should be a way to do both haven't found it for c/c++ on commandline program
[07:44.21] <Entalyan> You CAN get VS to compile C++ for the CLR, but that's not default, and only useful in specific circumstances

[07:45.54] <Entalyan> That is also specific for C++/CLI, not base C++
[07:46.06] <guest342156743> yes i know but i was wondering what the switch to the compiler is to affect the machine code or bytecode generation would it be just /clr omitting or emitting it to the compiler
[07:46.15] <guest342156743> like cl /clr
[07:46.17] * happy-dude (uid62780@gateway/web/irccloud.com/x-coynblvbhcqovzap) Quit (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
[07:46.21] <guest342156743> cl
[07:46.24] <Entalyan> Yeah just remove /clr
[07:46.33] <guest342156743> would determine the difference
[07:46.43] <guest342156743> ok then that was it
[07:47.03] <guest342156743> what the visual studio properties are using cool
[07:47.05] <Entalyan> This would have been a lot faster if you would have just asked that last question :p

[07:52.04] <guest342156743> O and F# is fsc , j# is  vjc ,...etc curious what is the linker if any used do they all uses the same linker as c/c++ LINK or do they have specific different ones... currently i don't have my windows visual studio's up and running so can't check the compiler/linker options/configurations

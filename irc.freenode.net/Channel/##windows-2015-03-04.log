[09:57.04] <thingfish> Guys, I can't figure this one out.  All my music is backed up to OneDrive, but I actually play music out of the default Music directory on the main disk drive.  Everything is normal in WMP - except for two albums by the same group (recent addition).  They always appear in duplicate in WMP unless I delete them from the OneDrive Music folder.  I'm stumped.
[09:57.31] <thingfish> No other duplicates from any other mp3s.

[09:58.12] <thingfish> Why would WMP see files on OneDrive anyway?
[09:58.19] * Log1x (~Log1x@unaffiliated/log1x) has joined channel ##windows
[09:58.41] <thingfish> I mean unless you pointed your default user directories to their corresponding OneDrive directories.

[09:59.05] <aeon-ltd> is the 'music' folder a library or does wmp look up libraries not just folders?
[09:59.31] <thingfish> oh good question
[09:59.55] <thingfish> yes but why would it not do this for all the songs on the drive?  It just does it for these two albums.
[10:00.12] <aeon-ltd> depends what folders are part of the library

[10:01.33] <thingfish> well true, of course, but these albums are in the same place as every other album I have.
[10:02.17] <thingfish> maybe it's a feature.  Windows knows I really like the music and figures I'll want to hear every song twice.  :)
[10:02.47] <thingfish> anyway it's no biggie.  It's just that I'd sure like to figure it out.

[05:20.57] <lyxia> atomicalloy: I clearly think about and define what I'm counting in terms of combinatorial strucutres. A handshake is determined by two people, 1) can they be the same? no. 2) does it make sense for one person to be before the other? no. Hence we are counting (unordered) pairs of people, i.e. combinations of 2 people among 24.

[06:15.55] <edlinde> How do I read this term? P(x,y|H)
[06:16.20] <edlinde> is it the joint probablity of x and y, both conditioned on H?

[06:17.14] <g0th> x and y both conditioned on H yes
[06:17.25] <edlinde> ok
[06:17.34] * SZero (~Chris@131.204.254.73) has joined channel ##math
[06:17.59] <edlinde> so can this be like  P(a|b) where a = x,y and b = H ?
[06:18.13] <g0th> P(x and y happens given H happened) = P(x happened given y and H happened) * P(y happened given H happened)

[06:18.25] * ZysFryar is now known as ZystemFryar
[06:19.25] <g0th> for simplicity first consider the trivial case (H always happens)
[06:19.25] <edlinde> g0th: ok then how does the chain rule apply there?
[06:19.29] <g0th> P(x and y) = P(x)*P(y)
[06:19.55] <g0th> well you need some assumptions on x,y like independce
[06:19.55] <g0th> etc
[06:20.08] <g0th> all of this is like 15 years back for me
[06:20.18] <g0th> hmm or 10
[06:20.26] * Rickmasta (~Rick@pool-74-101-29-191.nycmny.fios.verizon.net) has joined channel ##math

[06:20.45] <edlinde> what I am not seeing is how they applied the chain rule
[06:20.52] <g0th> otherwise take y=x and you see the error
[06:21.08] <edlinde> since the chain rule works on  things like P(a,b,c,…) joint probabilities

[06:23.08] <g0th> hint: if you want to understand all of this I strongly suggest you think of x,y,H,etc as 2 dimensional regions
[06:23.18] <edlinde> ＋＋http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_rule_%28probability%29，，
[06:23.26] <edlinde> I am looking at this for the chain rule ^^
[06:24.04] <g0th> yeah P(x,y)=P(x|y)*P(y)
[06:24.41] * zz_ezio is now known as ezio
[06:24.44] <g0th> the remark about independence was for my formula above
[06:24.55] <g0th> if you write it the way just know that looks ok in general
[06:25.06] <g0th> that's the most basic chain rul
[06:25.12] * Rickmasta (~Rick@pool-74-101-29-191.nycmny.fios.verizon.net) Quit (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[06:25.33] <edlinde> yeah but from that basic chain rule you just wrote out.. how do I apply that to the original equation?
[06:25.55] <g0th> well if you think about it in terms of regions and intersections
[06:26.01] <g0th> its pretty clear
[06:26.15] * paulp_000_ (~quassel@128-73-242-172.broadband.corbina.ru) has joined channel ##math
[06:26.15] <edlinde> from  P(x,y)=P(x|y)*P(y)   can you generalise it to say —> P(x,y|H) = P(x|y,H)P(y|H) = P(y|x,H)P(x|H) ?
[06:26.53] <edlinde> g0th: I can see that x,y is the intersection.. but what is x|y in terms of regions? :)
[06:27.01] <g0th> that's what was written above
[06:27.28] <g0th> x,y are intersecting discs
[06:27.44] <edlinde> ok.. then
[06:28.17] <g0th> x|y would mean the area of x intersected with y in relation to the area of the outside of x intersected with y

[06:29.08] * TheBigDeal (~quassel@unaffiliated/innocent99) Quit (Remote host closed the connection)
[06:29.08] <g0th> if you ask me about a precise proof I leave that for someone else / homework
[06:29.16] <g0th> it's a valid question
[06:29.26] <g0th> but I don't wanna think about it, sorry ^^
[06:29.41] <g0th> just saying it's very intuitive
[06:29.42] <edlinde> yeah I am basically seeing how to apply that simple rule and get that complicated beast :)
[06:29.46] <edlinde> ok cool no worries
[06:30.02] * HenriettaSalt (~Henrietta@eduroam-160-126.dyn.carleton.edu) has joined channel ##math
[06:30.03] <g0th> but do you understand the analogy with discs etc?

[07:36.50] <lrs> zHafydd, you mean i should look for how many times 31^n goes into 16007
[07:37.13] <wlczkun> sorry about it, i'm being a shit
[07:37.38] <zHafydd> lrs: no, that isn't what I said at all. I'm asking you if you understand that the number of times 31 divides 32014! is related to the prime factorisation of 32014!.

[12:09.42] <sd20> Stryyker: Well, I don't get it.
[12:09.53] <sd20> I thought Program Files was where non-user-specific data went.

[12:33.38] <VaccinesHARM> sukeruke, does ebay.com work
[12:33.58] <sukeruke> yes
[12:34.12] <VaccinesHARM> Is this a public wifi?
[12:34.19] <sukeruke> yes
[12:34.32] <sukeruke> that is why i didnt close the modem yet
[12:34.55] <VaccinesHARM> well do you think the owner of the access point is doing it intentionally?
[12:35.22] <Aldem> So, you're asking how you can access sites that the hotstop doesn't permit ?
[12:35.33] <sukeruke> VaccinesHARM, no
[12:35.43] <VaccinesHARM> Aldem, he says it redirects to a fke flash player download on certain sites
[12:35.56] <Aldem> Phishing
[12:36.11] <alan`> sukeruke: what browser are you using?
[12:36.28] <VaccinesHARM> yeah make sure any proxies are turned off in your browser
[12:36.33] <Aldem> Install AdBlock for your browser.
[12:36.37] <sukeruke> all the browsers have the same problem
[12:36.45] <sukeruke> Aldem, already have adblocker
[12:36.54] <VaccinesHARM> It's possible that you aren't connected to the AP that yo uthink
[12:37.04] <VaccinesHARM> or somebody installed malware on the wireless access point
[12:37.25] <VaccinesHARM> have you tried any other wireless hotspots?
[12:37.28] <Aldem> Or the manager is using poor DNSs
[12:37.38] <sukeruke> even if i log in from phone same problem
[12:37.43] <Aldem> But this is more of a ##networking talk sukeruke
[12:37.48] <Aldem> Not a Windows one
[12:37.49] <VaccinesHARM> oh so the problem is on your computer then
[12:38.02] <VaccinesHARM> he likely has windows malware
[12:38.08] * Mr_X (Mr_X@unaffiliated/mr-x/x-3310228) has joined channel ##windows
[12:38.09] <sukeruke> no cause i have same problem from phone
[12:38.17] <VaccinesHARM> oh I see then
[12:38.20] <sukeruke> Aldem, probably
[12:38.27] <alan`> sukeruke: wait, only on that network or data as well
[12:38.44] * Benjaminhusky (~compusr71@38.129.215.226) has joined channel ##windows
[12:38.45] <sukeruke> alan`, what you mean?
[12:38.50] * Techspectre (~daniel@ool-4572e6b2.dyn.optonline.net) has joined channel ##windows
[12:38.55] <VaccinesHARM> does your phone have a data plan
[12:38.59] <alan`> yea
[12:39.21] <alan`> i would turn off the wifi and try to load the websites on data on the phone, if you get that same problem then it infected your phone and your computer
[12:39.26] <sukeruke> ah yes i dont have data
[12:39.31] <sukeruke> i didnt pay for it
[12:39.35] <alan`> what kind of phone do you have?
[12:39.37] <VaccinesHARM> a user at the wireless hotspot could be playing ARP games, or the could have set up rogue DHCP with bad DNS
[12:40.06] <sukeruke> ARP?
[12:41.10] <VaccinesHARM> the protocol that maps IP address to the MAC ethernet address on a LAN. By generating fake ARP packets, it's possible for someone to trick a host in to sending IP packets to the wrong MAC address or in other words trick it to sending to another host
[12:41.27] * silv3r_m00n (~enlighten@122.163.34.240) has left ##windows ()
[12:41.33] <VaccinesHARM> that host then modifies the data and transmits it on to the correct destination
[12:42.24] <Benjaminhusky> hey,is anyone else having trouble getting the latest signatures for security essentials?
[12:42.44] * sydbarret (~proxychec@190.186.146.182) has joined channel ##windows
[12:42.57] <VaccinesHARM> there are a couple of ways in which someone could cause trouble at a wifi hotspot, and this is one of them.
[12:42.57] <sydbarret> anybody awake?
[12:43.14] <sydbarret> i have win8 and i wanna print with a lpt1 printer
[12:43.27] * oeuvre (~E6500@unaffiliated/oeuvre) Quit (Quit: May the stars shine down on you.)
[12:43.28] <VaccinesHARM> I love my LPT printer
[12:43.29] <sydbarret> my pc have only usb though
[12:43.44] <VaccinesHARM> With IRQ & DMA enabled in windows, it does 3MB/sec with 0% CPU use
[12:43.44] <sydbarret> I have the usb lpt1 adpater
[12:44.09] <sydbarret> but the driver is not supported in win8
[12:44.12] <sydbarret> any trick?
[12:44.19] <sukeruke> VaccinesHARM, so you think that a user of the wifi is probably the fault? why would someone do thisN
[12:44.35] <VaccinesHARM> to install spyware on your computer
[12:45.02] <VaccinesHARM> but they could have accessed the access point and left some malware on that
[12:45.16] <VaccinesHARM> or they could modify the DNS servers on it and set them to their own malicious ones
[12:45.17] <sydbarret> Vaccine do u have a lpt port in yer pc?
[12:45.59] * fev3r101 (~fev3r101@116.251.214.209) has joined channel ##windows

[12:46.19] <sukeruke> VaccinesHARM, people here are not experts on pcs
[12:47.27] <VaccinesHARM> My old HP printer doesn't have anti refil chips on the ink, and I can get perfectly good expired ink for only $4 on eBay
[12:47.54] <Benjaminhusky> gosh,that is pretty awesome
[12:48.03] * Haxxa (~Harrison@CPE-120-149-49-246.oirx3.win.bigpond.net.au) Quit (Quit: ZNC - ＋＋http://znc.in，，)
[12:48.10] <Benjaminhusky> probably saves you quite a bit
[12:49.34] <VaccinesHARM> sukeruke, it's probably not something that can be fixed properly without advanced knowledge, but you could try to manually set your DNS servers to good ones if that is the problem (4.2.2.2 and .3 and .4 are AT&T DNS)
[12:49.45] <VaccinesHARM> or get some kind of proxy services set up like OpenVPN

[12:56.20] <VaccinesHARM> sydbarret, do you have an LPT1 port that shows up then?
[12:56.28] * Mr_X (Mr_X@unaffiliated/mr-x/x-3310228) Quit ()
[12:56.39] <VaccinesHARM> you probably have to add or modify the printer to print on that port after it is plugged in to USB
[12:56.59] * filadome_ (~filadome_@216.151.180.63) Quit (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[12:57.18] <sydbarret> my pc is relative new and it didnt come with lpt1 port but when i add a printer I chose the nearest one to my LX 810 which appears as LX 300 in win8

[12:57.42] <sydbarret> nearest driver i meant from the list
[12:57.43] <VaccinesHARM> what PORT is it on that is what matters
[12:57.52] <sydbarret> on the ports tab
[12:57.55] <VaccinesHARM> oh
[12:58.00] <sydbarret> i tried with LPT1 and usb001
[12:58.04] * armyriad (~armyriad@66-214-18-26.dhcp.lnbh.ca.charter.com) Quit (Remote host closed the connection)
[12:58.08] <sd20> I thought Program Files was where non-user-specific data went.  But there is both both Program Files, Program Files (x86), ProgramData and %APPDATA%.
[12:58.11] <VaccinesHARM> win8 likely doesn't include a driver for that printer
[12:58.18] <sydbarret> yes it doesnt
[12:58.38] <VaccinesHARM> you'll have to download the driver and hope it is supported
[12:58.49] * sukeruke (~sukeruke@unaffiliated/sukeruke) has left ##windows (("Leaving"))
[12:59.00] <sydbarret> is not supported i bought this printer in 1987
[12:59.13] <sydbarret> but here is a guy that i think has the solution ＋＋http://superuser.com/questions/182655/how-do-i-simulate-a-parallel-lpt-printer-with-a-usb-printer，，

[01:01.35] <Stryyker> sd20: nope, some devs may have done it but since the inception of NT Program Files should have been about the non-changing things.
[01:02.11] <sd20> Stryyker: Do you not get what I'm asking?
[01:02.18] <sd20> Basically: why is there a ProgramData dir?
[01:02.23] <sd20> Why isn't that data put in Program Files?
[01:02.41] <sd20> Note that I'm not involving %APPDATA%, because that data makes sense to be separate.
[01:02.48] <Stryyker> ＋＋http://stackoverflow.com/a/27181428/555420，， with links to references
[01:02.54] <sd20> Yeah... you already linked to that.

[01:04.35] <VaccinesHARM> sydbarret, even if your computer had a parallel port it won't work without th edriver
[01:05.42] <VaccinesHARM> unless you want to print text only or from MSDOS
[01:06.00] <sd20> Stryyker: Yes, and it *did not explain anything*.
[01:06.03] <sd20> Do you know yourself?

[01:07.57] <sydbarret> VaccinesHARM i was able to print the test page
[01:08.03] <sydbarret> but i dont know why doesnt work now
[01:08.29] <VaccinesHARM> is the test page built in to the printer or the windows one?
[01:08.36] <sydbarret> i tried to plug with different usb holes thinking that might be the 3.0 or 2.0 issue
[01:08.46] <y0tta0> beware - he iss sysop/sysadmin on this channel - will boot you in an nano-second

[01:09.17] <sydbarret> VaccinesHARM i dont know but its a button in the properties icon of that printer
[01:09.19] <VaccinesHARM> does windows have nano second precision timers?
[01:09.40] <VaccinesHARM> so the printer is installed but you can't print to it?
[01:09.43] <VaccinesHARM> other than the test page
[01:09.51] * Joufflu (~Jouffluxx@2602:306:8b23:1250:2554:b203:eda3:9401) has joined channel ##windows
[01:10.01] <VaccinesHARM> I would guess that it is an issue with using a driver for such a different model of printer
[01:10.16] <sydbarret> yes that is the problem the driver is not supported
[01:10.21] <sydbarret> not even for winxp
[01:10.22] <VaccinesHARM> well the test page would say windows 8 on it
[01:10.27] <sydbarret> worse for windows 8
[01:10.37] <VaccinesHARM> are you sure winXP doesn't have the printer driver built in?
[01:10.58] <VaccinesHARM> I'm not sure if win8 dropped printer drivers since XP or not
[01:11.01] <sydbarret> sorry winxp has it but dont want to print
[01:11.31] <y0tta0> VaccinesHARM - suspect it does - latest mawk returns systime() in nano-seconds since 1601 year
[01:11.59] <VaccinesHARM> it's probably not correctly installex in XP then
[01:12.06] <VaccinesHARM> y0tta0, haha good to know :)
[01:12.23] <VaccinesHARM> is 1601 the 1970 of unix?

[02:22.22] <S_SubZero> “rogue developer followed no guidelines and made their own app their own way”   You can say that about an app on any operating system, not just Windows.
[02:23.39] <Stryyker> And people still ignore advice to follow guidelines. For example last year I noticed a few asking for help with some things and they had it in their mind they must put settings files in Program Files and it must be full RW access for all users. So they do odd hacks which removes security.

[04:21.19] Channel Created on: 7:11 PM 10/7/2005
[04:21.19] <meow> gparted has a pretty solid reputation i think...minitool, being a free windows program looks almost shadey...like it would be bundled with adware..but it's not...they sell a premium version i think
[04:21.38] * DrHouse|DellM650 (~mmanley@71-95-55-206.dhcp.rvsd.ca.charter.com) Quit (Ping timeout: 264 seconds)
[04:21.58] <mota> It hasn't been that long since we were getting a lot of 'gparted lost my data' issues here.

[04:22.37] <mota> I forget the specifics, since I didn't involve myself with them
[04:23.06] <mota> so I dunno. user error, gparted fail, can't say.
[04:23.11] * geothomm (~androirc@adsl-48.176.58.185.tellas.gr) Quit (Client Quit)
[04:23.22] <meow> or didnt rtfm
[04:24.05] <joga> personally I don't remember any "lost data" cases but it's not like I read 100% of this...
[04:24.19] <mota> whatever. I see partitions as folders that are really painful and dangerous to work with, and wish we'd just drop the idea
[04:24.22] <meow> i know gparted doesnt cooperate with intel software raid....i think it boils down to linux having it's own software implemtation and so intels isn't worthy of any effort

[04:26.21] <meow> yeah i agree..partitions are almost always stressful to tinker with when theres data in them that matters
[04:27.13] <mota> as we move away from disks and toward SSD, I'd love to see the concept of partition just fade away entirely.

[04:30.18] <meow> I've stopped trying to dual boot linux and windows....it's too much work and you have to reboot from one to the other.  I use virtual machines now to run linux on windows....not ideal performance perhpas but it's convenient

[04:40.48] <croon> Hey folks, is anyone here good with NTLM(v2)? I'm trying to implement it in Java for Soap requests, and I imagine there's a thousand ways to do it, but I've gotten the authentication working with apaches httpclient v4. What I'm wondering is if I can just extract the type 3 message and keep sending it in an Authorization header on other connections,
[04:40.48] <croon>  or if the NTLM handshake procedure needs to be done per connection (I know it has to be one connection start-to-finish to be successful, but I'm wondering about after it's successful)
[04:41.16] <meow> well im going to do that reboot..thanks again mota I'll be back if I need to blame someone : )

[04:44.45] <permalac> meow, I have many rules, and finally used all the space that the Exchange server has for it. I can not change the exchange size for the rules,  so I need something to organize de rules or a plugin to use instead.
[04:44.49] <permalac> any idea?

[04:51.00] <dionysus69> hey guys my user is member of vboxsf group but I still dont have permission to mount a windows drive in virtualbox, why :(?
[04:51.13] <meow> they make a few suggestions to work around the issue

[04:52.39] <dionysus69> yes on ubuntu guest :\
[04:52.48] <meow> assuming the drive is shared properly with vbox, did you use root to mount the drive on ubuntu?
[04:53.15] <meow> did you use sudo mount ....
[04:54.10] <meow> and did you install vbox tools or whatever the drivers/modules are called to make vbox cooperate with ubuntu?
[04:54.26] * Tron84 (~Tron@h253n19-vrr-d1.ias.bredband.telia.com) Quit (Quit: Leaving)
[04:54.39] <meow> I haven't used vbox in a while, I use VMWare myself
[04:55.09] <dionysus69> VMware, is it better??
[04:55.39] * Rickmasta (~Rick@pool-74-101-29-191.nycmny.fios.verizon.net) Quit (Quit: My MacBook Pro has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[04:56.00] <meow> I tried both a few years ago and ended up liking vmware because I could get openGL to work in KDE
[04:56.25] <meow> but theyre pretty similar...VMWare Player is the free version..still quite useful, and Workstation is the premium version
[04:57.01] <dionysus69> meow: do you know how I need to mount it at startup? I put fstab statement to mount, it does but I cant open it because the permission problem...

[04:57.50] * jackson (~jackson@dynamic-acs-24-154-29-150.zoominternet.net) has joined channel ##windows
[04:58.29] <meow> you looked in /mnt/ and its not there after booting?

[04:58.58] <dionysus69> meow its in /media but I dont have permission to open it, anyways I think I gave up, I ll just copy the folder I need to use on ubuntu side
[04:59.35] <meow> i think vmware had a similar problem for a while and i worked around it by adding a mount command to a init.d script that ran with root or something crazy i found online
[04:59.59] * Tron (~Tron@h253n19-vrr-d1.ias.bredband.telia.com) has joined channel ##windows
[05:00.09] <meow> you *might* be able to drag and drop files to and from teh vm..but big files will lag a bit
[05:00.09] * Tron (~Tron@h253n19-vrr-d1.ias.bredband.telia.com) has left ##windows ()
[05:00.10] <dionysus69> meow: ye exactly, i found lots of crazy stuff already i am done haha and none of them worked :s
[05:00.37] * gaffahiro (~AndChat73@dab-glb1-h-66-4.dab.02.net) has joined channel ##windows
[05:00.42] <dionysus69> ye dunno its buggy even drag n drop doesnt work
[05:00.44] <meow> maybe if you use sudo to mount it from media
[05:01.24] <meow> there's also the option of sharing with the network using samba
[05:01.29] <dionysus69> meow that works one time, I dont want to run that command every time i run vm
[05:01.50] <dionysus69> meow ye maybe i ll check that samba option out, seems the easiest way so far
[05:01.53] <meow> ive personally never been successful with fstab ever
[05:02.03] <meow> i suck at fstab i guess
[05:02.35] <dionysus69> meow ye for me linux syntax isnt consistent, every file seems to have its own syntax, fstab syntax was like wtf for me
[05:05.55] * barq (~101715417@unaffiliated/barq) has joined channel ##windows
[05:07.03] <meow> yeah..ive just never had success booting correctly after doing anythign with fstab

[05:08.55] * S_SubZero (~S_SubZero@about/windows/regular/s-subzero) Quit (Quit: S_SubZero)
[05:09.21] <meow> im sure theres a hax way that you can put the mount command into one fo the startup scripts that load after the vbox sharing modules load instead of before...i think thats why fstab is problematic
[05:09.43] <meow> I just cant find a page to reference with that information

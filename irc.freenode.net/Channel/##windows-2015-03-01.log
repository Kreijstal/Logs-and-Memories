[08:44.42] <SCHAAP137> i wonder, why does Windows 8.1 (maybe other versions as well) not see available updates sometimes? I just did a clean install in a VM, afterwards it gave me 49 + 3 updates
[08:44.50] <SCHAAP137> installed them, reboot, then it said no updates available
[08:44.58] <SCHAAP137> reboot again, now it says 9 important + 1 optional
[08:45.01] <SCHAAP137> why the extra reboot?
[08:45.12] <SCHAAP137> doesn't make sense imho
[08:45.39] <SCHAAP137> is it like some kind of grace time inbetween update installs or something?
[08:45.49] <SCHAAP137> anyone know what the deal is with this inconsistent functionality?

[08:52.08] <randombrain> SCHAAP137, after installing the first round of 49 +3 updates windowsupdates has to search for new updates again. as long as the search isn't finished, there are no new updates available. chances are you rebooted before the search was done. the search finished after that and displayed the other updates.
[08:52.36] <SCHAAP137> randombrain, i manually initiated the update check after that reboot, and waiting until it completed
[08:53.00] <SCHAAP137> and it said no updates, only after _another_ reboot i initiated it again, manually
[08:53.00] * DexterLB (~dex@87-126-22-45.btc-net.bg) Quit (Client Quit)
[08:53.04] <SCHAAP137> and then it found 9 + 1
[08:53.18] * genera (~genera@unaffiliated/genera) has joined channel ##windows
[08:53.29] <SCHAAP137> so that explanation wouldn't hold
[08:54.40] * DexterLB (~dex@87-126-22-45.btc-net.bg) has joined channel ##windows
[08:55.30] <SCHAAP137> i suspect some kind of update-install-grace-time is being applied, maybe in a few minute intervals, to depend on the cache of the previous update search when it happens in the same time interval
[08:55.35] <randombrain> SCHAAP137, no idea about why the sequence was like it was then. I'd still guess it's a timing issue. it's quite normal that you have to do multiple "rounds" of windows updates though.
[08:56.14] <SCHAAP137> i'm equally wondering what it could cause

[09:07.01] <Entalyan> Windows Update is a remote code repository that checks for new patches once in a while, similar to SVN (in theory, not in implementation). Pacman (arch linux update system), and as far as I know apt-get as well, do the exact same thing. The only difference is that Windows patches can apply to the operating system as a whole, while linux is split into many subcomponents, each with their own
[09:07.02] <Entalyan> code repositories and updates.
[09:07.12] * r3kt (~r3kt@unaffiliated/alpha) has joined channel ##windows
[09:07.13] <randombrain> SCHAAP137, just think about the scale. windows updates are rolled out to hundreds of millions of devices with even more different OS versions, and about always work without a glitch. (again, the last couple of months were borked, but I hope they'll cover that soon). "1 download, 1 install, 1 reboot" isn't feastible, thinking of incremental updates which depend on each other... you wouldn't
[09:07.13] <randombrain> want even a small "100 mb" download to just update a single file, would you?
[09:07.44] <Entalyan> I don't see how either one is more efficient or less efficient than the other. They just make more sense in relation to their own OS architecture.
[09:08.02] <randombrain> and the update process itself is quite complex. you just can'
[09:08.05] <SCHAAP137> it would be a huge step forward already if the system would be able to detect _all_ of the updates it needs, without having to do multiple runs
[09:08.12] <randombrain> t replace a "in use" file like this.
[09:08.24] <randombrain> SCHAAP137, see above. incremental updates.
[09:08.46] <SCHAAP137> well, incremental is just sequential in that sense, one after the other
[09:08.53] <randombrain> you usually don't do full backups all the time.
[09:09.01] <randombrain> (just as example)
[09:09.04] * khanman (~khan@74.215.219.231) Quit (Remote host closed the connection)
[09:09.41] <SCHAAP137> To me it's not clear why multiple runs and multiple reboots would be needed; in theory the system could be altered to handle incremental updates differently and more efficiently
[09:09.44] <randombrain> SCHAAP137, kernel32.dll has to be replaced. how would you do it?
[09:09.47] * fleshtheworld__ (~fleshthew@2602:306:cf0f:4da0:a99f:ad7d:40cf:1a3b) has joined channel ##windows
[09:10.12] <LMNOP> windows update is fine
[09:10.21] <SCHAAP137> load kernel32.dll in memory, use it from there, make a copy in a temporary dir, update that, copy it back, reload it from the original location

[09:11.09] <randombrain> SCHAAP137, what about all the other processes that depend on the recently loaded kernel32.dll? that have opened it? loaded it somewhere in either private or shared memory?
[09:11.33] <randombrain> updating windows is pretty complex. lots of things to consider.
[09:11.34] <SCHAAP137> close the processes before updating the file, afterwards restart them using the new libraries?
[09:11.48] <randombrain> SCHAAP137, so just closing like your browser just out of the blue?
[09:11.53] <randombrain> SCHAAP137, or networking?

[09:13.04] * MissionCritical (~MissionCr@unaffiliated/missioncritical) has joined channel ##windows
[09:13.16] <randombrain> in a perfect world we wouldn't need windowsupdates, because there would be no bugs. or other features, because all of them would already be there.
[09:13.30] <SCHAAP137> linux and BSD can do it, just replace a file that's seemingly in use; it doesn't matter because the earlier version was loaded into RAM/the kernel at runtime

[09:17.10] <SCHAAP137> 8.1 runs amazingly well in virtualbox btw, almost faster than natively on this machine
[09:17.10] <randombrain> Entalyan, windowsupdates (especially the security updates) do quite the opposite. they disguise what they're actually doing.
[09:17.29] <Entalyan> Most of the time you won't care. But if you ever tried to roll back a specific patch, or see if perhaps you installed a patch that could have changed behaviour in component X, you'll know what I mean. A long list of KB-numbers is not enough information, and neither is package versions.
[09:17.43] <SCHAAP137> that's good i think, a normal user doesn't need to know the details of an exploit and the way a security update fixes it

[09:52.48] * WormDude is now known as WormFood
[09:52.52] <Entalyan> That's because the calendar is synced to the cloud...
[09:53.16] <sabotender> which is craptastic. What if I just wanted the calendar to be synched with my local devices only?
[09:53.29] <sabotender> what if I didn't want microsoft to know my daily schedule and business?
[09:53.31] <Entalyan> Then you get another calender app?
[09:53.38] <sabotender> you are missing the point.
[09:54.02] <sabotender> They don't even give you that option. Its like, use our cloud network or you can't use our software
[09:54.07] <sabotender> yet it is included by default
[09:54.56] <sabotender> I will be honest with you, I do not completely trust Microsoft with my personal data.
[09:55.15] <Entalyan> You can turn off syncing with the accounts in calendar. Or have it sync with a different cloud provider.
[09:55.22] <Entalyan> Just checked.
[09:55.25] <sabotender> Oh, and the installer makes it extremely difficult to install 10 without signing up for a live account

[10:00.25] <Entalyan> OSX actually does

[10:02.30] <sabotender> all this forcing to use a live account is a big deal for me. an os should be separate from the online services that it provides.
[10:02.30] <Entalyan> The principle is the same though. There's plenty of MS apps that don't require the login (ie. the non-Windows Store apps)
[10:03.18] <sabotender> They shouldn't include it by default then. It gives a false impression that you can actually use the software if you are using a local-only account.
[10:03.48] <sabotender> it should be an add-on that is available from the store, which, understandably, would require such a live account.
[10:04.08] <Entalyan> It's also not like Calendar has always been offline-only and now suddenly tries to force you to use a cloud account... There just wasn't any calendar app in the pre-Cloud environment.

[10:28.33] <sinshiva> i've even run an Arch VM on this
[10:28.49] <sabotender> and I am talking about a quad core CPU, a GPU with its own dedicated memory and at least 4GB of RAM
[10:29.10] <sinshiva> i get 90fps at native res in ut2004 :p
[10:29.25] <sinshiva> native res being 1366x768, though
[10:29.32] <sabotender> Entalyan: I completely disagree with you. I advise that you run the w10 installer again to see which OBVIOUS options it gives you in terms of online integration
[10:29.40] <sabotender> and how difficult it is to create a local-only account.
[10:30.42] <sinshiva> oh, z3745 cpu, if it makes a difference
[10:31.01] <sabotender> sinshiva: oh, I did fail to mention that the ativ 500T ran a non-RT environment on the tablet. I was really interested in it because it had its own stylus and that it could run real windows applications

[10:32.56] <sabotender> Entalyan: and I am not talking about convoluted twenty thousand clicks to get to an option that is embedded within the installer, either. I am talking about obvious options that are given that the average user has access to.

[10:54.14] <MaSOuD> (Resharper)
[10:54.20] <Entalyan> MaSOuD: Yeah you can say that about all those languages I just named, without the .NET specific abbreviation attached they are not .NET.
[10:54.20] <Shannon> until last year, Visual Basic was the last language I studied in school
[10:54.53] <MaSOuD> Shannon: VB sucks

[10:55.02] <MaSOuD> Either VB6 or VB.NET
[10:55.07] <MaSOuD> All the way.

[10:56.15] <Shannon> OK, but what you're saying is non-sensical. Visual Basic 6 is a version of Visual Basic.
[10:56.19] <SCHAAP137> VB6 is classic
[10:57.00] <Shannon> BASIC was a very common language to learn when I started using PCs
[10:57.02] <Entalyan> Shannon: Actually VB.NET is a revamped, and arguably new, language, that came after VB6 and it's predecessors.
[10:57.29] <Shannon> Entalyan, that makes perfect sense ...
[10:57.33] <MaSOuD> Entalyan: Have a research, no one uses VB.NET
[10:57.45] <Shannon> Have a ESL class
[10:57.48] <MaSOuD> Even those who knew VB(.NET) before C#
[10:57.53] <Shannon> i'm about to go blind with anger on your ass

[11:01.03] <Shannon> in any case, I find it immmeasurably helpful to understand a language from its original syntax, ie in BASIC, instead of a hopped thing like .NET and C# first.
[11:01.32] <Shannon> i have no problems learning any BASIC variant as such, and telling me BASIC is "obsolete" is a really big "No Shit, Sherlock"
[11:01.58] <Entalyan> MaSOuD: Have an actual research and don't go with what you feel must be the truth based on a limited perspective of the development community. VB.NET is huge and has always been huge, and has a great many refinements in it that still lack in C#. They are nowadays functionally equivalent though, it's mostly down to quality-of-life constructs.

[11:06.15] <MaSOuD> I leave you guys to it.
[11:06.23] <jameswine> BASIC was the basic building block for a lot of todays common languages.

[11:06.44] <MaSOuD> Yeah, like you do.
[11:06.45] <Shannon> BASIC spurred the home PC revolution
[11:06.58] <Shannon> because i was programming in 1991 when Visual Basic came out, yes, i do
[11:06.58] <MaSOuD> It doesn't mean it's good
[11:07.08] <MaSOuD> Back then there was lack of other languages

[11:11.33] <SCHAAP137> it's pretty bad but it gets the job done, somehow

[11:11.57] <MaSOuD> Still true
[11:12.00] <Foxhoundz> Except shell. Shell solves everything
[11:12.05] <Foxhoundz> and C
[11:12.06] <MaSOuD> But we'll never get on the same page about VB.
[11:12.15] <Shannon> Entalyan, i was going to say something about "it depends on your problem and your experience and how you think, generally)
[11:12.21] <Entalyan> This happens to be the PHP tool, but it is still a tool: ＋＋https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7226/7095238893_5000f6e57d.jpg，， ;)
[11:12.25] <Shannon> then you're a fucking goon and there's nothing left to it
[11:12.36] <jameswine> Like I wouldn't do string in FORTRAN, but some other language
[11:12.39] <Foxhoundz> Shannon: watch the language
[11:12.49] <Shannon> i see it just fine

[11:13.05] * MissionCritical (~MissionCr@unaffiliated/missioncritical) has joined channel ##windows
[11:13.07] <Shannon> in any case, i dont know much abotu PHP other than it's used on like half the web
[11:13.15] <Shannon> so it must be useful in some way
[11:13.33] <MaSOuD> Even more than half
[11:13.33] <Entalyan> Erm, well that logic is flawed.
[11:13.42] <Entalyan> But that wasn't the point :p
[11:13.49] <Shannon> Entalyan, my conclusion is that it must be useful if it is in use
[11:14.02] <MaSOuD> Not necessarily.
[11:14.17] <jameswine> you're assuming that web developers are completely rational
[11:14.22] <Shannon> hahahahah
[11:14.24] <Entalyan> Shannon: Well, the only conclusion you can take from that is that it is capable of producing functional applications
[11:14.26] <Shannon> is that like economics?
[11:14.36] <Foxhoundz> I am a PHP developer and the reason I use it is because
[11:14.39] <Foxhoundz> ...it pays...
[11:14.47] <Shannon> my guess is the reason why PHP isnt very great is because it doesnt have a specification or standard
[11:15.02] <Shannon> some things do well without out, i guess, but you need someone like Sun/Oracle watching out
[11:15.07] <MaSOuD> The reason that most of websites are PHP is simply because it's open source and free
[11:15.16] <Entalyan> Actually it does. It's just that the standard contradicts itself on so many points you might as well not have a standard :p
[11:15.17] <MaSOuD> There's no other good reason..
[11:15.26] <Foxhoundz> MaSOuD: and because a lot of popular CMS use PHP
[11:15.34] <Shannon> in general if i wanted to pick up any kind of scripting langauge, or i was recommending it to someone, i would definitely say Python and Perl
[11:15.52] <Shannon> and then Tcl ... but Foxhoundz ... that always comes up ... it pays
[11:15.58] <MaSOuD> Foxhoundz: Which comes back to what I said, that's the root.
[11:16.03] <Entalyan> Oracle now owns the PHP of databases, MySQL :p And Java VMs aren't that stellar either nowadays :p

[01:00.31] <ultramage> hi, would someone help me un-break task scheduler on win2008r2? I'm trying to get daily rotation of Performance Montor logs, but it's not rotating them (win7 handles it fine)
[01:02.47] <ultramage> one of the task scheduler actions is to 'end task', and one of the task options is "if task is already running, stop the old instance"; the task created by perflog has an $(Arg0) commandline argument, and I assumed this is a 'thing' that the task scheduler substitutes when running (I imagined it would be the string 'start' and 'stop')

[01:03.57] <ultramage> however, when I captured the actual operation, it sent the literal string '$(Arg0)', showing that 1) the argument is meaningless, and 2) this is now tasks are notified that they are being stopped.
[01:04.15] <ultramage> so I wonder, when you click 'end task' in task scheduler, what exactly happens?

[01:24.05] <lenswipe> great.
[01:24.19] <S_SubZero> did the hardware change?

[01:29.17] <S_SubZero> long story short, the upgrade doesn’t like your key for whatever reason.  Was your Win8 activated before you tried doing the upgrade?
[01:29.40] <lenswipe> S_SubZero, no idea, it never asked me for a key so I just assumed it automatically read it from the BIOS
[01:30.00] <blkshp> I downloaded a copy of 8.1 when i formatted, thinking i could use my key from 8, i couldnt.

[01:30.55] <lenswipe> when i factoried it obviously went back to windows 8
[01:31.14] <ultramage> they probably have perfectly tuned procedures for handling "the windows I purchased won't activate"
[01:31.15] <lenswipe> oh and it wont connect to my wifi for whatever reason

[01:31.49] <ultramage> what is a 'factory reset' in this case?
[01:32.04] <lenswipe> ultramage, windows 8 has a tool in it to factory reset your laptop
[01:32.14] <lenswipe> i chose the one that wiped all my programs and settings but only on the C:\ drive
[01:32.21] <lenswipe> (didnt want to lose the drivers on D:\)
[01:32.37] <ultramage> usually I reserve that term for re-imaging windows xp from a hidden ACER partition by pressing F11 during boot
[01:32.39] <lenswipe> I have to say - it's easy to see why people pirate software. I'm a legit paying customer and the legitimate upgrade path isn't ****ing working.  D:<

[01:33.51] <blkshp> lenswipe. confirm for me, did you use factory reset in 8.1 that is now trying to reinstall 8.1 or did you factory reset back to 8 and now are trying to upgrade back to 8.1?
[01:34.05] <S_SubZero> blkshp: for a manual way, “rweverything” (＋＋http://rweverything.com/，，) has a MSDM table reader to get the individual key.  While 8.1 won’t auto-activate against it, you can enter it manually after using the “get me past the activation page” key for your version.

[02:13.37] <hmmwhatsthisdo> komugi: is MSE really enough? We use Forefront/Endpoint Protection at work which, to my knowledge, is essentially enterprise-grade MSE and we've always run under the assumption that MSE is the last thing to detect badware
[02:13.41] <lenswipe> i have to say, it looks quite nice
[02:13.56] <komugi> Endpoint is HIPS
[02:14.06] <komugi> common sense + MSE is enough
[02:14.10] <komugi> but if you don't trust yourself enough
[02:14.13] <komugi> you can use other stuff
[02:14.32] <komugi> we have Endpoint for end users at work, and only because we don't trust them
[02:14.33] <komugi> :P
[02:14.44] <komugi> if you want further security
[02:14.57] <komugi> the easiest thing is create an User account
[02:15.02] <komugi> and not an admin

[03:10.36] <Peppi> sec

[04:47.33] <Metronome> Hey, I am having trouble trimming video files.  I tried using Windows Movie Maker, and think I inputted all the video specs accurately, but the video file it outputs is horrendously laggy.  Surely there's a way to simply cut the beginning and end off of a file without utterly twisting, pounding, and recombobulating it until its quality is lowered.  I feel like I'm overkilling the problem.  Any ideas?

[06:11.33] <neagle3> For 10 straight hours now, I've sat here and uninstalled network adapters and reinstalled them and whatnot in my VM which I need all day, every day, because today, when I woke up after having changed NOTHING the last night, it suddenly has no Internet access.

[06:13.08] <aias> are you using vmware or vbox?
[06:13.12] * MissionCritical (~MissionCr@unaffiliated/missioncritical) has joined channel ##windows
[06:13.13] <neagle3> VMware Player.
[06:13.26] <aias> hmm, i have no experience with it..
[06:13.30] <neagle3> VirtualBox is too much of a nightmare with issues.
[06:13.42] <aias> i have working virtual networks ;)
[06:13.51] <neagle3> I had until today.
[06:13.56] <aias> tbh i use it because it's free
[06:13.57] <neagle3> And what makes you think it's VMware?
[06:14.08] <neagle3> It's clearly something that Windows is doing.
[06:14.11] <neagle3> At least clearly to me.
[06:14.16] <Da|wo> wich light linux os you recc for using with vbox ?
[06:14.22] <Da|wo> about to pick one flavor rightnwo
[06:14.52] <aias> pff, i go arch. but that's not a good choice for a quick start
[06:14.56] <Stryyker> It isn't clear what is the issue.
[06:15.01] <yart> debian based for beginners
[06:15.03] <aias> perhaps debian
[06:15.06] <sepeck> tthere are plenty o fchannels to discuss linux and which to choose on :)
[06:15.14] <Da|wo> thx yart
[06:15.26] <Stryyker> neagle3: Did you check event viewer of the virtual OS?
[06:15.41] <pault> Aias: ntoskrnl.exe and hal.dll seem to be the culprit most times.
[06:15.47] <aias> does your network adapter do anything in the windows vm ?
[06:16.04] <Stryyker> pault: Then it is likely drivers, hardware or malware and not those files.
[06:16.25] <neagle3> Stryyker: What should I look for?
[06:16.26] * MissionCritical (~MissionCr@unaffiliated/missioncritical) Quit (Max SendQ exceeded)
[06:16.35] <aias> ntoskrnl.exe and hal.dll are both pretty damn important
[06:16.42] <pault> Stryyker: quite the combination of things :(
[06:16.57] <aias> are they in the final columns of BlueScreenView's output?
[06:17.14] <aias> occasionally it's a driver that ntoskrnl doesn't like
[06:17.19] <neagle3> I can never make any sense whatsoever from that awful mess that is "event viewer".
[06:17.30] <pault> aias:  yes
[06:17.31] <neagle3> It's just a mishmash of random logs IMO.

[06:18.05] <aias> neagle3: does you network adapter to _anything_ ?
[06:18.12] <pault> I attempted to reinstall most drivers and reformat and its still the same problem. Would this point towards a hardware issue?
[06:18.16] <aias> neagle3: at what point does it _stop working_ ?

Either the component that raises this event is not installed on your local computer or the installation is corrupted. You can install or repair the component on the local computer."
[06:19.10] <aias> exactly
[06:19.16] <Stryyker> pault: possibly. What stop codes are you getting? Have you tried memtest86+? Has it had the issue since new or has it developed? What has changed since it was ok? (this stuff is mentioned in the link I provided earlier)
[06:19.37] <pault> Aias: sorry which other tests should I look to try, i'm not too familiar with tech issues like these.
[06:20.08] <neagle3> 169.254.197.97
[06:20.16] <neagle3> Which is the usual nonsense address.
[06:20.27] <aias> neagle3: you could try statically assigning and IP and gateway
[06:20.28] <Stryyker> nonsense? It has a name.
[06:20.30] <pault> Stryyker: I had no issues prior to the installation of a new water cooler/case. And my 2 hard drives had gotten static damage and had to get 2 new ones, ever since a lot of BSOD.
[06:20.37] <neagle3> It worked yesterday. Then I shut it down. Today when I start it up, the network is just dead.
[06:20.43] <aias> neagle3: it sounds like a stupid idea, but it could just work
[06:20.57] <aias> neagle3: virtual network adapters can be touchy sometimes
[06:20.58] <Stryyker> pault: static damage? Could other components been damaged?
[06:20.59] <neagle3> This is ridiculous...

[06:21.13] <neagle3> What the hell can I do other than uninstalling and reinstalling it 100 times?
[06:21.19] <neagle3> It doesn't help to do so.
[06:21.21] <Stryyker> neagle3: What host OS?
[06:21.22] <neagle3> I've rebooted it 1000 times.
[06:21.27] <neagle3> Windows 8.1 Update 1 too.
[06:21.34] <aias> neagle3: have you tried statically assigning an IP and gateway to the adapter in ipv4 properties?
[06:21.38] <neagle3> So both the host OS and the guest OS is the same.
[06:21.45] <pault> Stryyker: I'm not sure, I took it in to a computer tech and he changed all the parts in a static-free environment. I believe he tested the other parts
[06:21.46] <neagle3> aias: No. That's not related.
[06:21.53] * MissionCritical (~MissionCr@unaffiliated/missioncritical) has joined channel ##windows
[06:21.54] <aias> try it anyway
[06:22.05] <neagle3> No. I don't have any static ones.
[06:22.12] <aias> it'll take 10 seconds. much shorter than installing 1000 times
[06:22.15] <neagle3> This has never been the case before and makes no sense.
[06:22.41] <Stryyker> pault: Can you run with less drives connected? Which order do you install the drivers? IS Windows up to date?
[06:22.47] <pault> Stryyker: Im thinking of taking the computer back to him, hopefully there is an easy fix. I will try some of these tests though.
[06:22.50] <aias> to me, i don't know how it can make sense either. but in some cases it has fixed issues with virtual adapters

[06:23.55] <pault> Stryyker: Windows 8 64 without 8.1 update, since I was getting BSODs on 8.1 I reformatted back to 8 to see if that was the cause. Driver installation I tried a lot of different types, CPU/GPU first sometimes.
[06:24.14] <pault> most times* cpu/gpu drivers first
[06:24.22] <aias> neagle3: vbox comes with 'guest additions', "installed inside a virtual machine after the guest operating system has been installed. They consist of device drivers and system applications that optimize the guest operating system". i don't know if vmware has any equivilent
[06:24.38] <Deihmos> bsod could mean memory failure or other hardware issue
[06:24.48] <aias> neagle3: did you try giving the adapter static ipv4 address and gateway ?
[06:24.57] <Stryyker> pault: try chipset first. Generally strip things back to basic to reduce complexity

[11:59.09] <alan`> my dad brought home one of the retired work laptops, i ended up doing a registry edit to allow me to "upgrade" to windows professional from enterprise so i could use the key on the back w/o losing office etc from the machine, he went ahead and did 16 versions of bios updates and driver updates and when i woke up this morning to finish it it hangs at the windows 7 booting splash screen and when i boot into safe mode it hangs on classpnp.sys

[12:31.29] <Serpentine_> How do I find the k-th number of the n-nacci sequence in under O(log(k)) time?
[12:31.36] * _Atom_ (~jawat@108-73-1-253.lightspeed.austtx.sbcglobal.net) has joined channel ##math
[12:31.49] <antonfire> "the n-acci sequence" needs elaboration

[12:32.30] <barfod> -naccified
[12:32.52] <barfod> yeah i just made that up
[12:33.20] <barfod> I interpreted it as fibonnaci number sequence extrapolated from N
[12:33.22] * lavender (~anonymous@146-115-146-205.c3-0.nwt-ubr1.sbo-nwt.ma.cable.rcn.com) has joined channel ##math
[12:33.36] <barfod> though i also just made that up
[12:33.46] <Serpentine_> f(x<0)=0, f(0)=f(1)=1, f(2)=2, f(x>2)=sum of f(x-u) for u in {1<=u<=(n+1)}
[12:34.00] <antonfire> barfod: If you think "fibonacci number sequence extrapolated from N" doesn't need elaboration, you are wrong.
[12:34.10] * edlinde (~ed@p54842926.dip0.t-ipconnect.de) has joined channel ##math
[12:34.19] <barfod> yeah i assumed as much
[12:34.36] <barfod> that's why I am here, to learn
[12:34.44] <antonfire> Serpentine_: the k-th term in that sequence has more than log(k) digits.

[12:35.00] <antonfire> So log(k) time isn't even enough time to write it down once you've computed it.
[12:35.21] * revolve (~username@199.19.119.133) Quit (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[12:35.29] <pedro3005> just say "i've computed it" :>
[12:35.42] <Serpentine_> I actually only need the k-th number modulo 2^31-1
[12:35.53] * dj_pi (~dj@c-107-5-228-80.hsd1.mi.comcast.net) has joined channel ##math
[12:36.01] * revolve (~username@199.19.119.133) has joined channel ##math
[12:36.15] <Serpentine_> (so I assume that arithmetic operations always take constant time)

[12:36.20] * xCG (CvP@203.76.123.238) has joined channel ##math
[12:36.30] <antonfire> that's a repeating sequence.
[12:36.48] * _Atom_ (~jawat@108-73-1-253.lightspeed.austtx.sbcglobal.net) has joined channel ##math
[12:36.53] <antonfire> so if you can take k modulo some fixed number in constant time, you can use a lookup table.
[12:37.07] <antonfire> so hurray, you can do what you want in O(1) time.
[12:37.13] * xCG is now known as CvP

[12:38.10] <antonfire> of course, you can't take k modulo some fixed number in constant time, since it takes time O(log(k)) to even read all the digits of k.
[12:38.47] <Serpentine_> Well, I would definitely not want to incur the huge constant overheads
[12:39.24] * anthrnm (~vandrew@86.122.228.44) has joined channel ##math
[12:39.51] <Serpentine_> Additionally, while I do not need to make many queries of the k-th number, k is large (k>10^18)

[12:41.15] <Serpentine_> Well, I noticed that the k-th Fibonacci number can be found using matrix exponentation
[12:41.22] <antonfire> you're basically looking for the k'th power of a certain (n+1)x(n+1) matrix, modulo 2^whatever - 1.
[12:41.35] <antonfire> Which you can work out using repeated squaring.

[12:44.08] <timlyg> how do i figure out how many power of 2 procudes 20,000,000 digits?
[12:44.41] <Serpentine_> user123321: A decent approximation for the n-th prime number would be n ln n
[12:44.42] <user123321> Serpentine_, Aha

[12:46.30] * antonfire (~antonfire@unaffiliated/antonfire) Quit (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
[12:46.37] <Serpentine_> user123321: I doubt that we would ever find a closed-form formula for the n-th prime number
[12:46.46] <krator44> timlyg: base-10 digits?
[12:47.19] <timlyg> krator44: yea...my bad.
[12:47.47] <user123321> Serpentine_, What possibly could be preventing that?

[12:49.54] <Serpentine_> user123321: One problem would be that no (non-constant) polynomial function f(n) will have prime values for almost all n

[12:53.15] <krator44> but you want 2^n = 10^20M
[12:53.26] <timlyg> yea
[12:54.09] <krator44> so if you take log base 2 of both side you're gonna have the answer
[12:54.26] <timlyg> krator44: I get you now...it's simple math, i can't believe it...THANKS!!
[12:54.56] <timlyg> krator44: Now i can work on my primality test algorithm, muahaha...
[12:55.32] <timlyg> krator44: but I don't think I can solve it - the largest prime known. But it will help my curiosity

[01:12.18] <Travisty> Given a convex polytope P in R^d, P will have some number of corners. Is it true that for each corner, call it c, there is an invertible d by d matrix H and a vector b so that c = H^{-1}b?
[01:12.40] <Travisty> Clearly, actually, taking H = I and b = c, this holds

[01:17.44] <Z-module> hi

[01:21.26] <math780> hey, can anyone explain me how to convert 4bits signed number to 8bits signed number? i know how to do this with unsigned numbers only
[01:21.44] <sure> well, vector spaces are action of a field over a commutative group
[01:21.50] <sure> modules are action of a ring over a commutative group
[01:21.53] <cads> Z-module, what gets me is that all the vector spaces over a field fall into a neat linear heirarchy according to the cardinality of their bases
[01:22.00] <gniourf> sure, it's more than just an action

[01:46.34] <timlyg> sure: those are beyond me
[01:46.38] <sure> oh and by the way, you don't solve problems because you try to solve them explicitely, but because you find theories and concepts that solve them
[01:46.39] <dude12312414> yeah. Faster than currently known ones

[02:15.33] <rudi93> sure every self-adjoint operator is unitarily equivalent to a multiplication operator on some L^2 space
[02:15.54] <rudi93> you can apply any borel measurable function to that multiplication operator

[02:16.21] <sure> ah nice, how do you prove the first thing
[02:16.25] <rudi93> and define the new domain as the domain such that the application of that borel function to a vector is still square-integrable
[02:16.30] <sure> i think its something i used to know without proving it
[02:17.18] <rudi93> the proof is a little bit longer. you can find it in reed&simon vol.1 for example

[02:18.21] <rudi93> dude12312414 usually physicists only prove it for schwartz functions
[02:18.29] <rudi93> dude12312414 because they are lazy

[02:19.27] <rudi93> yea
[02:19.31] <sure> that is their decrease is faster than any power of
[02:19.31] <sure> x
[02:19.37] <dude12312414> Well bounded would be easy enough to prove too :P
[02:19.49] <sure> and rudi93, its not that physicist are lazy, its that they don't do the maths required to understand it
[02:20.16] <rudi93> not all of them are stupid :p
[02:20.17] <sure> not by lazyness, but because there is no good theoretical physics formation
[02:20.32] <gniourf> dude12312414, bounded is not enough

[02:29.58] <dude12312414> Newton was a physicist and invented the math to go with it :P
[02:30.09] <sure> newton was before all a mathematician
[02:30.12] <sure> (and religious)
[02:30.34] <krator44> or something such as +2k and -2k if you think that it converges
[02:30.48] <krator44> but i dont think it does
[02:30.54] <b0g> how do you guys feel about mathematica's documentation? i just snagged a copy of it from my uni and it seems really neat, but should i learn R instead?
[02:31.01] <g0th> hmm, can someone help me with poisson brackets/algebras?
[02:31.08] <gniourf> krator44, it does converge to ln(2). Problem was solved a long time ago
[02:31.13] <rudi93> g0th what about it
[02:31.17] <gniourf> g0th, ask
[02:31.19] <g0th> how does it work if you have a graded algebra?
[02:31.29] <g0th> I have something which looks very much like a poisson bracket
[02:31.37] <gniourf> then you have a graded Poisson bracket
[02:31.37] <g0th> but it is not linear/distributive or how you call it
[02:31.49] <sure> poisson bracket is supposed to be bilinear
[02:31.59] <sure> otherwise you don't have an algebra
[02:32.00] <g0th> [f1+f2, g] != [f1,g] + [f2,g]
[02:32.08] <sure> is there a sign somewhere ?
[02:32.12] <gniourf> g0th, then it's not a PB
[02:32.23] <sure> whats the grading
[02:32.27] <g0th> ＋＋http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0509653，，
[02:32.34] <g0th> its the ring of quasi modular forms

[02:33.50] * Happzz (void@unaffiliated/ducch) has joined channel ##math
[02:33.58] <g0th> the issue is that for "depth <= s" parts the bracket is defined depending on the "s"
[02:34.13] <g0th> but if you split <= s parts one part might be strictly lower than s
[02:34.30] <g0th> in which case strictly by definition the bracket for this function will have another s

[02:36.15] <hmmwhatsthisdo> my math prof didn't really go over multivariable proofs that well, so I'm not sure how good it is
[02:36.19] <sure> maybe there's an abstraction of it somewhere
[02:36.48] <sure> ＋＋http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rankin，，–Cohen_bracket
[02:36.51] <g0th> sure: they generalized the construction from zagier
[02:36.57] <g0th> which defined a poisson bracket
[02:37.14] <g0th> but I don't get how their definition gives you a poisson bracket because of the issue of non-linearity
[02:37.20] <sure> well its not
[02:37.35] <g0th> maybe it can be fixed by looking at it the right way
[02:37.37] <gniourf> hmmwhatsthisdo, looks good. FYI this is called Bernoulli's inequality
[02:37.42] <sure> it has to be an algebra g0th
[02:37.46] <g0th> maybe I have to restrict the bracket to fixed depth parts?

[02:38.16] <gniourf> :)
[02:38.20] <g0th> sure: I'm not sure about the definitions of poisson brackets/etc for graded/filtered stuff
[02:38.29] <g0th> sure: in this case we have both
[02:38.31] <sure> i guess it has to be compatible with the grading

[02:38.52] <sure> sth like that
[02:39.09] <g0th> it satisfies properties like that
[02:39.17] <g0th> even the leibnitz rule
[02:39.21] <g0th> and more
[02:39.27] <g0th> so it is for sure something interesting
[02:39.29] <sure> yes thats because its also a derivation
[02:39.50] <g0th> you mean the new rankin cohen bracket?
[02:39.52] <g0th> or the old one?

[05:10.25] <carp> Hello. I would like to go through a simple probability question again, but trying to learn the correct terminology. I am looking at the wikipedia page at this section: ＋＋http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability#Independent_events，，
[05:11.08] * Mulder (~Mulder@unaffiliated/mulder) Quit (Quit: Leaving)
[05:11.09] <carp> P(roll a 5 or 6, with 1 allowed re roll)
[05:11.30] * Guest99246 (bojangles@2a01:7e00::f03c:91ff:fedb:182b) has joined channel ##math
[05:11.57] <Karlo_> So, you roll one die, and if it's not 5-or-6, you get to roll a replacement, I guess.
[05:12.05] * kexmex (~kexmex@195.42.130.233) has joined channel ##math
[05:12.25] * eyvindandersen (~eyvind@80-71-135-9.u.parknet.dk) has joined channel ##math
[05:12.30] <carp> karlo yes.
[05:12.40] <Karlo_> What's your question?
[05:12.43] <carp> ok so, if we roll the die once, is that called a single performance?
[05:13.43] <Karlo_> "Performance" doesn't sound like the right word.
[05:14.01] <Karlo_> Oh, I guess it's like performing an experiment.
[05:14.03] * tarkus (~hello@109.230.140.12) has joined channel ##math
[05:14.08] <Karlo_> Yes.
[05:14.34] * `Eddie (~dedword@unaffiliated/eddie/x-2286721) has joined channel ##math
[05:14.47] * Aniball (~Barthalom@69.6.118.196) Quit (Ping timeout: 264 seconds)
[05:14.57] <Ozera> sounds like it would be right
[05:15.06] <carp> 1 performance of an experiment, ok cool
[05:15.36] <carp> so then, the event is the outcome of that first performance, which can either be a {5,6} or {1,2,3,4}
[05:16.01] <Karlo_> OK
[05:16.21] <carp> or actually, is the event either a 1, or 2, or 3, or 4, or 5, or 6 ?
[05:16.41] <carp> actually, i think thats what the {} mean
[05:16.53] <carp> ignore that last bit then whoops.
[05:17.12] <Karlo_> The sample space is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}; *any* subset of this sample space is a valid "event".
[05:17.21] <carp> ah ok great.
[05:17.41] <Karlo_> {1}, {2}, {3}, {4}, {5}, {6} are the singleton events that each have equal probability by assumption.
[05:17.51] <carp> subset or powerset also known as right?
[05:18.15] <Karlo_> {5,6} is the compound event that, in this particular experiment, counts as "success".
[05:19.08] <Karlo_> If S = {1,2,3,4,5,6}, then the power set P(S) is the set of all events; the probability measure is a function from P(S) to [0,1].
[05:19.27] <Karlo_> I.e., for each event, there's a probability of that event occurring.
[05:19.30] * elsewho (~elsewho@gna.informatik.tu-freiberg.de) Quit (Disconnected by services)
[05:19.36] <carp> karlo ok
[05:19.57] * elsewho_ (~elsewho@gna.informatik.tu-freiberg.de) has joined channel ##math
[05:20.13] <Ozera> It's useful to draw a tree diagram or probabilities
[05:20.40] * ess_tee_u (~NULL@unaffiliated/ess-tee-u/x-83456671) has joined channel ##math
[05:21.06] <carp> so now, i am looking at the wiki page again, and there are 4 options. (independent events, mutually exclusive, non mutual, and conditional)
[05:21.17] <Karlo_> Note that the relation between "subset" and "power set", in general, is that "A is a subset of S" is equivalent to "A is an element of P(S)".
[05:21.28] <carp> now, what i would like to know is can it only be ONE of these 4 options?
[05:21.53] <Karlo_> No
[05:22.08] <carp> phew, good cus that was messing me up a bit i think haha
[05:22.15] <Karlo_> That section might not be laid out as well as it should be.
[05:22.40] <carp> the explanations when you click on each one are really confusing too
[05:22.47] * robot-beethoven (~user@c-24-118-140-127.hsd1.mn.comcast.net) Quit (Quit: ERC Version 5.3 (IRC client for Emacs))
[05:22.55] <Karlo_> Those are just four examples of cases where there's a rule for computing the probability.
[05:23.05] <carp> or im just really dumb, more likely
[05:23.46] <carp> so if we go back to my example of rerolling a failed 5 or 6.
[05:24.14] * uku (~uku@49.31.180.213.sta.estpak.ee) has joined channel ##math
[05:24.22] * d_k (~dk@cpc68034-cmbg14-2-0-cust100.5-4.cable.virginm.net) Quit (Quit: d_k)
[05:24.28] <carp> i will try to say if i think any of those 4 categories apply
[05:24.48] <smbullet> How would I find the impulse response of this Cascade series? ＋＋http://mathb.in/28660，，
[05:25.04] <Karlo_> "A is independent of B" is sometimes *defined* to mean P(A and B) = P(A)P(B) (in which case it's clearly a symmetric relationship); other sources define it to mean P(A | B) = P(A), in which case the symmetry is less obvious, but the equivalence follows from how P(A | B) is defined.
[05:25.20] <carp> independent events; well the first roll doesnt affect the probability of the second roll. so yes they are independent.
[05:25.23] * Isp-sec (~palach@95-28-18-117.broadband.corbina.ru) Quit (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[05:25.26] <smbullet> Or more simply how would I calculate that convolution?
[05:25.38] <Karlo_> That's correct, the first and second rolls are independent.
[05:26.27] * liquidfl0ppy (~chris@c-73-204-78-199.hsd1.fl.comcast.net) Quit (Quit: Leaving.)
[05:26.34] <carp> karlo_ the second formula you posted there is the formula for the conditional on the wiki page right?
[05:26.48] <carp> oh wait no, sorry my mistake
[05:27.31] * preschema (~preschema@essn-d9bb4e61.pool.mediaways.net) has joined channel ##math
[05:27.52] <carp> ok cool so they are independent. but we dont use that formula cus it doesnt apply to the problem
[05:28.15] <Karlo_> It might be useful later.
[05:28.25] <carp> ok
[05:28.41] * SomeT (~SomeT@cpc3-leic16-2-0-cust382.8-1.cable.virginm.net) has joined channel ##math
[05:28.42] <carp> next, are they mutually exclusive. well, first i need to say what event 1 and event 2 actually are..
[05:29.31] <carp> event 1 is {5,6} on the first roll
[05:29.32] <carp> event 2 is NOT {5,6} on first roll AND {5,6} on second roll
[05:29.39] <carp> is that correct?
[05:29.48] <carp> this part really screwing me up haha
[05:29.55] <Ozera> Cale, I was confused last night mostly because I didn't read the definition of a n cross polytope
[05:30.14] <Ozera> carp, have you drawn a tree diagram
[05:30.17] * z0kk_ (~textual@49.213.28.28) Quit (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[05:30.45] <Karlo_> Ozera, carp is still dealing with the terminology; let's not get into the solving methods just yet.
[05:30.53] <carp> ozera yes and i have actually solved the problem already yesterday, but now im trying to getthe wording right
[05:31.03] <Ozera> mm
[05:31.31] <Karlo_> Let me voice my objection to the Wikipedia page...
[05:31.43] <carp> ah that makes me feel better haha
[05:32.12] * struktured (~carm@2604:2000:dd21:3e00:b859:d21b:85fb:6e03) Quit (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[05:32.29] <Karlo_> P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B) is actually true for *any* events A, B, despite it being written under the heading "not mutually exclusive".
[05:33.15] <carp> ok yes
[05:33.17] <Karlo_> Since the *definition* of "mutually exclusive" is P(A and B) = 0, the formula simplifies to P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) in that special case.

[05:34.08] * jonascj (~jonas@083073242129.mbb.telenor.dk) Quit (Ping timeout: 255 seconds)
[05:34.12] <carp> yes i believe that is exactly (one) of the the things that was catching me out
[05:34.47] <carp> ah thanks for pointing that out
[05:35.01] <Karlo_> For your problem, it's simplest if we consider event A = {5,6} on the first roll, and B = {5,6} on the second roll.
[05:35.45] <carp> see that is something i thought it might be, ok lets go with that then
[05:36.04] <Karlo_> (The problem was stated in such a way that the second experiment is never performed if first experiment already determined the outcome; however, it simplifies things if we treat it as always performed, and simply ignored if its outcome is irrelevant.)
[05:36.34] * fatalhalt (~fatalhalt@c-71-201-7-76.hsd1.il.comcast.net) Quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[05:37.12] <carp> ok yes. its one of those where you can choose what method to work it out, and one of the methods is to count some outcomes twice, then subtract that at the end
[05:37.20] <Karlo_> Yes
[05:38.00] <carp> there doesnt seem like an easy way to determine when this is the case or not, you just have to be good at reasoning or something
[05:38.14] <carp> or like oz was saying use a tree diagram i guess
[05:38.32] <carp> but that is impractical for a 3 event situation heh
[05:38.35] * Adib (~Adib@5249A66B.cm-4-2c.dynamic.ziggo.nl) Quit (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[05:38.52] <Karlo_> Well, with A and B defined as above, the problem is to find P(A or B), so the formula applies.

[05:38.57] * bigbadjesus (~666@unaffiliated/psidrome) has joined channel ##math
[05:39.16] <Karlo_> And that brings P(A and B) into play, and *now* it becomes relevant that A and B are independent.
[05:39.24] * superlinux-hp (~oracle@unaffiliated/superlinux) has joined channel ##math
[05:39.41] <carp> ah awesome, this is progress. but how do i know that we arent meant to use the conditional formula
[05:40.18] <Karlo_> Because the problem didn't mention any conditionals?

[05:40.58] * hodgeclass (algebraicc@cpe-75-80-48-51.san.res.rr.com) has joined channel ##math
[05:41.00] <carp> or i mean, would i use the conditional formula if i used the events that i outlined, not the ones you suggested
[05:41.22] * bigbadjesus (~666@unaffiliated/psidrome) Quit (Client Quit)
[05:41.47] <Karlo_> Yeah, maybe.  I pretty much ignored it since there were two easier ways to work on the problem.  :-)
[05:41.54] <carp> righto
[05:42.23] <carp> so before we go on, i havent actually determined if they are mutually exclusive or not formally
[05:42.29] * efm is now known as efm_
[05:43.08] <carp> using your suggested events, it seems kind of clear that they are mutually exclusive
[05:43.25] * z0kk (~textual@101.50.89.74) has joined channel ##math
[05:43.33] <carp> but using my suggested events, would it be different?
[05:43.36] <Karlo_> The two events that I defined are *not* mutually exclusive, because it's possible for both to occur.
[05:43.49] <carp> oh darn
[05:44.04] <carp> oh yes, yes i geddit
[05:44.11] <Karlo_> In fact, we already noted that they're independent -- and mutual exclusion is kind of the *opposite* of independence.
[05:44.14] * coffeeee (~coffeeee@cpe-174-103-113-161.columbus.res.rr.com) has joined channel ##math

[05:44.40] <carp> how about with the 2 events i suggested?
[05:45.12] <carp> event 1 is {5,6} on the first roll
[05:45.17] <carp> event 2 is NOT {5,6} on first roll AND {5,6} on second roll
[05:45.23] <Karlo_> You defined A = {5,6} in first experiment, and B = ({1,2,3,4} in first experiment and {5,6} in second experiment}.
[05:45.29] <Karlo_> Those *are* mutually exclusive.

[05:47.13] <carp> heres a stumbling block for me, cus the wiki page says about 'single performance.' so now i need to get the terminology right..
[05:47.28] <Karlo_> So, since P(A or B) still describes the question you were originally asked, you could use the formula P(A) + P(B).  But now P(B) is harder to compute.
[05:47.35] <carp> a single performance that could lead to event 1 would be only a single roll whereas...
[05:48.01] <carp> a single performance that could lead to event 2 would INCLUDE rolling twice. is that right?

[05:51.06] <carp> ah i think i was reading it incorrectly
[05:51.29] <Karlo_> That's in the definition of "P(A or B)", aka "P(A u B)".
[05:51.48] <carp> so in the example, event A occurs on a the first (single) performance, whereas event B occurs on BOTH the first and the second performance

[05:52.17] <Karlo_> Btw, I said that there were two simpler ways to do it.  The first is the one I already mentioned: A={5,6} on first die, B={5,6} on second die, use formula for P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B).  I should mention the second method, too.

[05:53.49] <carp> i might start using that method more often
[05:53.57] * efm_ is now known as efm
[05:54.11] <Karlo_> So, instead of finding the probability of "5 or 6 on first roll, OR 5 or 6 on second roll", you can find the probability of "5 or 6 on NEITHER roll". and complement that.
[05:54.24] <carp> yeah.
[05:54.35] <Karlo_> This avoids the inclusion-exclusion thing, though in this case it's about the same amount of work.
[05:55.25] <Karlo_> It's useful to know both methods, and in this case I'd recommend solving it both ways to confirm that they agree on the answer.
[05:55.40] <carp> ill do that. good idea
[05:56.45] <carp> may i be a pain and just brute force my worse method a bit longer too?
[05:56.50] <carp> so in the example, event A occurs on a the first (single) performance, whereas event B occurs on BOTH the first and the second performance
[05:57.44] <Karlo_> You're defining B = (first-{1,2,3,4} AND second-{5,6}) here?

[06:00.11] <swifte> Karlo_; who is the observer?
[06:00.43] <carp> event B is a compound event, and involves performing both experiments. OK that sounds great.

[06:03.34] <Karlo_> Event A requires the first experiment to have outcome {5,6} while event B requires the first experiment to have outcome {1,2,3,4}.  *That* is why they're exclusie.

[06:08.41] <carp> OK so, we now finally get onto actually selecting a formula, and it has to be the mutually exclusive one. which is the one that doesnt include subtracting the intersection
[06:09.04] <carp> that might be a mistake though.
[06:09.37] <Karlo_> Yeah.  As I already mentioned, the other formula is valid for *any* events, but P(A and B) = 0 because (A intersect B) is the empty set.

[06:12.08] <Karlo_> And the empty set has probability zero, either by axiom or by an easy consequence of the axioms.

[06:12.38] <carp> cool yep
[06:13.33] <carp> when you said Yeah, that was saying i had selected the right formula, and NOT that i had made a mistake

[07:35.22] <carp> I believe I made a series of gross mistakes above, and I think i have solved it. I switched event A and event B in the formulas by mistake. So after re doing the calculation properly, ( 2/6 * 4/6) / (4/6) =    (8/36) / (4/6) =    48/216 =   2/9
[07:35.28] <pedro3005> well, each component of f(v) depends on all components of v, but yea

[07:35.56] <carp> previously i said i was expecting 5/9 but now i believe that this 2/9 is correct so yay. ignore me sorry.
[07:36.02] <pedro3005> but then this is nothing else than the fact that composition of linear functions is linear, and projection in some component is a linear function
[07:36.52] <Fourteen> Hmm, okay. I had tried it before where X and Y were the tangent vectors and were both sums of a_i ∂/∂x_i   and b_i ∂/∂x_i, and pi*X and pi*Y were similarly c_i ∂/∂y_i and d_i ∂/∂y_i. (where each y_i is x_i/(1-x_0) I then tried to get from one to another by conputing a jacobian, but even then I can only get them to match when x_0, a_0 and b_0 are all zero

[07:39.05] <pedro3005> X = (a_0, ..., a_m), Y = (b_0, ..., b_m). so the standard inner product is gonna be a_0 b_0 + ... + a_m b_m. now apply the differential of pi to X and to Y, and get something, and compute their inner product, and hopefully you get some z such that z/(a_0 b_0 + ... + a_m b_m) = 4/blabla

[08:13.27] <ekaj> I thought I had the correct method, but my graph for the lower part was way off.. so that's wrong.

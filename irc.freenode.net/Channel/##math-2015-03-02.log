Session Ident: ##math
[12:00.06] <calmdown> u have no reason to use it fresh you dont write papers for math
[12:00.12] <SL0P3> There's a 98% chance that anything you read on a computer with math symbols is LaTeX.
[12:00.27] <SL0P3> unless it's just things like + and -

[12:01.46] <Freshrr> Calmdown, not knowing this stuff is making me worry.
[12:01.55] <calmdown> god ur dumb
[12:02.02] <Freshrr> :(
[12:02.03] * exactly_ (~exactly_@ti0145a400-1399.bb.online.no) has joined channel ##math
[12:02.04] <calmdown> u think i give a shit about latex
[12:02.16] <calmdown> ive never used it and i probably wont for a whil
[12:02.19] <SL0P3> Freshrr
[12:02.23] <SL0P3> unless you're majoring in math
[12:02.29] <SL0P3> this stuff is 99% irrelevant
[12:02.34] <Freshrr> Welll
[12:02.54] <SL0P3> Even engineering wont use any of the math people talk about in here.
[12:02.58] <Irrelium> Freshrr: yeah, latex isn't common for high school students to know
[12:02.58] <Freshrr> I am gonna major in Physics and we all know math is very closely related to Physics.
[12:03.02] <SL0P3> No.
[12:03.29] <Irrelium> I have never used latex, I just know what it is
[12:03.45] <Freshrr> Am I wrong in saying math is very closely related to Physics?
[12:03.52] <SL0P3> Yes.
[12:03.59] <Irrelium> You will use a lot of math in physics
[12:04.01] * `Eddie (~~deadword@unaffiliated/eddie/x-2286721) Quit (Quit: the mac is asleep)
[12:04.19] <Freshrr> I see I see.
[12:04.21] <SL0P3> You will use lots, but it's much different than learning stuff things like topology.
[12:04.28] <SL0P3> *stuff
[12:04.49] <calmdown> Freshrr you are perfectly fine just go to school
[12:04.53] <Irrelium> I haven't checked, but I imagine you at least need calc 1, 2, and 3, plus differential equations and such
[12:05.01] <Freshrr> No calmdown....
[12:05.04] <SL0P3> All of those are computational math...
[12:05.04] <Irrelium> But you can take all those at college
[12:05.11] * UidX (~UidX@unaffiliated/uidx) Quit (Remote host closed the connection)
[12:05.15] <SL0P3> so you *shouldnt* struggle.
[12:06.00] <Freshrr> I want to go to a good college though, and If I don't know the higher level math I will not get in.
[12:06.09] * qeed (~qeed@ip98-169-57-14.dc.dc.cox.net) Quit (Quit: qeed)

[12:07.33] <Freshrr> GT isn't a top physics school.
[12:07.40] <calmdown> yaya
[12:07.52] <SL0P3> Freshrr...
[12:08.00] * doot_ (60feb305@gateway/web/freenode/ip.96.254.179.5) Quit (Client Quit)
[12:08.10] <SL0P3> even CalTech doesnt expect to see anything past about calculus.
[12:08.19] <SL0P3> and CalTech is states through the roof.
[12:08.32] * DarkBloodWolf (~muffins@unaffiliated/darkbloodwolf) has joined channel ##math
[12:08.37] <SL0P3> *stats
[12:08.37] <Freshrr> I simply don't believe that....
[12:08.45] <_kmh_> GT=?
[12:08.56] <calmdown> georgia tech
[12:09.00] <_kmh_> oh
[12:09.07] <Freshrr> I bet they don't accept anyone who hasn't taken the high level maths
[12:09.27] <Freshrr> i.e.  Calc and beyond
[12:09.30] <SL0P3> ....
[12:09.37] <_kmh_> Freshrr,  depends what degree you apply for
[12:09.39] <SL0P3> Calculus is
[12:09.47] <SL0P3> almost mandatory for highschoolers...
[12:09.58] <SL0P3> Even the brick highschoolers I know have taken it.
[12:10.19] <_kmh_> well a first calculus is actually a highschool standard in many countries
[12:10.40] <SL0P3> I'm assuming do to the fact "he's close to GT"
[12:10.43] <SL0P3> he's probably in the US
[12:10.44] <Freshrr> I'm applying for Physics which is gonna be competitive.
[12:10.53] <SL0P3> At what schools?!
[12:11.06] <_kmh_> it is a bit of US or maybe anglo-saxon thing, that you can get a highschool diploma with taking calculus
[12:11.22] * Big_Seven (~on@host-89-243-59-52.as13285.net) Quit (Ping timeout: 264 seconds)
[12:11.33] <Freshrr> Well of course I'll take calculus, but that'll be  my senior year.
[12:11.39] <SL0P3> I know my HS class put 50% of the class through MV and a few went through CA before senior year.
[12:11.42] <Freshrr> Many highschoolers will take Calc 3
[12:11.43] <SL0P3> *complex analysis
[12:11.44] <Freshrr> !?!?
[12:12.00] <Irrelium> SL0P3: you from the us?
[12:12.04] <SL0P3> Yeup
[12:12.09] <SL0P3> went to a "rich kid" school tho
[12:12.18] <SL0P3> So my standards may be a bit fucked up
[12:12.21] <monoprotic> i went to a good public school and it only offred through calc 2
[12:13.00] <monoprotic> calc 3 in HS is weird, theres not even AP test for that
[12:13.04] <Freshrr> Slope what college are you at?
[12:13.17] <prasio> I went to a tiny farm school in teh midwest.   Only a hand full of us even TOOK calc 1
[12:13.19] <b0g> no seriously, where is physics anything but an open major?
[12:13.34] <SpurSearcher> I never took calc I in high school
[12:13.35] * pretodor (~pretodor@113.162.115.33) has joined channel ##math

[12:13.49] --pretodor-- logged in with account (pretodor)
[12:13.51] <prasio> Intro calculus  was considered  "Advanced PLacement Calculus" in my little corner of the world
[12:13.55] <Freshrr> SL0P3, what college do you attend?
[12:13.56] * zwisch (~zwisch@76-10-142-14.dsl.teksavvy.com) Quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[12:14.05] <SpurSearcher> I didn't even take advanced algebra
[12:14.50] <SpurSearcher> heck, I barely passed geometry
[12:14.56] <SL0P3> I went to Fu Freshrr
[12:15.11] <Freshrr> Lol.... wat

[12:15.32] <SpurSearcher> I went there too
[12:15.48] <SL0P3> Woop!
[12:16.10] <SL0P3> Fu is terrible to get into these days
[12:16.18] <SpurSearcher> actually, I never went there
[12:16.18] <SL0P3> some kid told me the average scores were in the 99th percentile
[12:16.21] <SpurSearcher> I thought you meant something else
[12:16.32] <monoprotic> lol
[12:16.44] <SL0P3> was like "wow, my degree must mean something"
[12:16.52] <SL0P3> "probs not tho"
[12:17.03] <Freshrr> I can't tell if you are trolling right now SL0P3

[12:18.28] * ZysFryar (~zysfryar@unaffiliated/zystemfryar) has joined channel ##math
[12:18.36] <SpicSpackSpock> Google "The Hedonistic Calculus"
[12:18.47] <SpicSpackSpock> it's a page where a man gives a very vague, biased explanation of how happiness and pleasure can be mapped on an integral scale from 1 to 10 without explaining why happiness ONE: would have an upper bound in its representation, and TWO: why the value couldn't assume negative values for the inhibition of pleasure, say suffering
[12:18.51] <SL0P3> 1997?
[12:18.53] <SL0P3> lol
[12:19.08] <SpicSpackSpock> Why haven't they made a model for pleasure yet
[12:19.09] <_kmh_> google "dirty math" or "impure math"
[12:19.12] <SL0P3> I'm still terrible at math compared to these guys.
[12:19.20] <SpicSpackSpock> Some way to map out pleasure to a single scalar value?
[12:19.27] <SL0P3> pleasure...
[12:19.33] <_kmh_> and "Polly Nomial" (the classic)
[12:19.34] <SpicSpackSpock> I mean, where are all of the applied mathematicians when we need them??
[12:19.35] <SL0P3> I'd say just count vaginas and add.

[12:19.49] <SpicSpackSpock> SL0P3: You're very crude
[12:19.49] <SL0P3> Spock, you died like
[12:19.53] <SL0P3> yesterday... gtfo.
[12:20.01] <SpicSpackSpock> hehe
[12:20.15] <SpicSpackSpock> in memoriam
[12:20.17] * NightRa (uid40361@gateway/web/irccloud.com/x-arzwryvlrdhsymyc) has joined channel ##math
[12:20.31] <_kmh_> actually

[12:21.00] * cj3kim_ (~cj3kim@unaffiliated/cj3kim) has joined channel ##math
[12:21.06] <SpicSpackSpock> We're nearly at the shore of complex systems so decomposing the human mind's seemingly chaotic complexity of experiencing pleasure as a systematic system of the collection of past experiences and current ones, we SHOULD have a system by now that can at least estimate pleasure.
[12:21.11] <_kmh_> there are some talks you can check out
[12:21.19] <_kmh_> in particular this one: ＋＋https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFVXsjVdvmY，，
[12:21.23] <SpicSpackSpock> The utilitarians keep making excuses and giving vague systems which only grace the lightest portions of math

[12:21.35] * astropirate (~astropira@c-73-203-60-11.hsd1.co.comcast.net) Quit (Changing host)
[12:21.35] * astropirate (~astropira@unaffiliated/astropirate) has joined channel ##math
[12:21.35] <SpicSpackSpock> Is that for me _kmh_?
[12:21.50] <SpicSpackSpock> And they don't even provide any rigorous proof as to why their "assumptions" and definitions are valid
[12:22.08] <SpurSearcher> what do you think it is SpicSpackSpock?
[12:22.12] <_kmh_> and this one ＋＋https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2vN2QXZGnc，，
[12:22.18] <SpicSpackSpock> Then again they ARE social scientists
[12:22.21] <_kmh_> for all of you
[12:22.28] <SpicSpackSpock> and social scientists are terrible mathematicians by trade
[12:22.31] <SpicSpackSpock> lol
[12:22.37] <_kmh_> ad all that mathematics of pleasure talk
[12:22.45] <b0g> i see that x in the TEDx and i tune out real fast
[12:23.08] <SpicSpackSpock> _kmh_ don't show it to me unless it has a concrete system that can be proven
[12:23.31] <SpicSpackSpock> I'm through with zoning through half-assy discussions by guys who think they're right because they use fancy wording
[12:23.35] <_kmh_> SpicSpackSpock,  whatever that means
[12:23.40] <SpicSpackSpock> I really hate social scientists
[12:23.47] <SpicSpackSpock> they're all sophists
[12:24.01] <_kmh_> in any case their are talks by mathematicians nd not sociologists
[12:24.16] <SpicSpackSpock> k, I'll click
[12:24.22] * Litt (~M@202-89-151-114.ue.woosh.co.nz) Quit (Read error: Connection timed out)
[12:24.28] <SpurSearcher> sexualists make poor neuroscientists for the same reason that paranoid schizophrenics make poor generals

[12:24.32] <_kmh_> SpicSpackSpock, lol as if it gets any more sophistic than math :)
[12:25.02] * Litt (~M@202-89-151-114.ue.woosh.co.nz) has joined channel ##math
[12:25.09] <SpicSpackSpock> but yeah, social scientists are like lawyers and any other liberal arts majors, they create fancy phrases to disguise the fact that they're using faulty logic, deceptive schemes and blanket assumptions to prove their points
[12:25.20] <SpicSpackSpock> That's essentially how you write proofs in psychology and law anyway :P
[12:25.23] <_kmh_> pure math is the king of sophistry of you will
[12:25.27] <SpicSpackSpock> >proofs
[12:26.07] <SpicSpackSpock> _kmh_ how? You can actually show anything that's accepted to be true, pure or applied, its still math
[12:26.11] <SL0P3> wat is an proof
[12:26.15] <SL0P3> how I proof that im tall?
[12:26.22] <SL0P3> where am I?
[12:26.28] <SL0P3> is this iceland?
[12:26.35] <_kmh_> SpicSpackSpock, try Tom Lehrer then (on sociology): ＋＋https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB97Qe2D4V0，，
[12:27.06] <_kmh_> SpicSpackSpock,  sorry - how what?

[12:27.56] * brett1479 (~brett1479@pool-173-56-121-99.nycmny.fios.verizon.net) Quit ()
[12:28.37] <SpicSpackSpock> how is pure math sophistic? You can follow any decent proof and show that its true, it isn't based on trying to pressure the audience that you clearly know what you're talking about and they should just blindly listen
[12:28.56] * orthoplex64 (~orthoplex@unaffiliated/orthoplex64) Quit (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
[12:29.10] <SpicSpackSpock> I can't even read a psych textbook without throwing it against the wall
[12:29.13] <SpicSpackSpock> seriously
[12:29.14] <SpicSpackSpock> lol
[12:29.22] <_kmh_> SpicSpackSpock,  what is more sophistic than a proof?
[12:29.39] * Anaphaxeton (~georgios@unaffiliated/anaphaxeton) has joined channel ##math
[12:29.40] <SpicSpackSpock> sophism is deceptive logic, which sounds right but is baseless lol
[12:29.56] * Mmango (~user@108-217-142-114.lightspeed.milwwi.sbcglobal.net) has joined channel ##math
[12:29.56] <SpicSpackSpock> unless you're arguing against objective truth and you don't believe in axioms
[12:30.04] <SpicSpackSpock> which would make me ask why the hell you're in #math
[12:30.08] <SpicSpackSpock> lol
[12:30.34] <_kmh_> SpicSpackSpock, pure math as such is "made up" (at least you can argue that) and may have zero meaning in the real world (though oddly enough it nevertheless in most cases does)
[12:31.10] <SpurSearcher> I don't know why I am here
[12:31.26] <_kmh_> not to mentrion there are plenty jokes treating mathematicians and lawyers alike
[12:31.28] <SL0P3> spock
[12:31.36] <SpicSpackSpock> wat
[12:31.39] <SL0P3> the reason people think math is "hard" is because people use symbols
[12:31.42] <SL0P3> and symbols = genius
[12:32.00] <SpicSpackSpock> Yeah, I guess that's sophism, but not to a trained mathematician lol
[12:32.08] <SpicSpackSpock> more symbols = more rigor
[12:32.30] * DarkBloodWolf (~muffins@unaffiliated/darkbloodwolf) Quit (Quit: I liked it when I was here, as well as when I'm not!)
[12:32.36] <_kmh_> well yes math is unfortunately often used for pretension and make something look "scientific"

[12:33.12] <SpicSpackSpock> I keep a whiteboard in my room where I write down integral identities so when my mom comes in my room she thinks I'm studying
[12:33.17] <_kmh_> SpicSpackSpock,  i don't see why that is any different for trained mathematician
[12:33.25] <SpicSpackSpock> lol, keeps her from giving me chores
[12:33.31] <_kmh_> SpicSpackSpock,  haha
[12:33.53] <_kmh_> SpicSpackSpock, sounds like a sheldon cooper approach
[12:34.22] * shikhin (~shikhin@unaffiliated/shikhin) has joined channel ##math
[12:34.23] <SpicSpackSpock> AFAIK trained mathematicians aren't impressed by more words and symbols for a proof
[12:34.38] <_kmh_> chessmaster used to have a "if the boss wanders by" menu item
[12:34.45] <SpicSpackSpock> in fact, I kept losing points in my intro to advanced class because my proofs were "too long"
[12:34.50] <SpicSpackSpock> and "not elegant"
[12:34.56] <_kmh_> if you select that the chessboard ges replaced by a spreadsheet
[12:35.06] <SpicSpackSpock> though my mother saw my tests and asked me how the hell I even managed in the class
[12:35.10] <SpicSpackSpock> lol
[12:35.28] <_kmh_> trained mathematician have rather different attitudes
[12:35.29] <SpicSpackSpock> lol _kmh_
[12:35.45] <_kmh_> some are all symbols others are rather wordy

[12:36.22] * astropirate (~astropira@unaffiliated/astropirate) Quit (Quit: This computer has gone to sleep)
[12:36.29] <SpicSpackSpock> my prof said if we could prove it in as few words as possible we'd get full credit
[12:36.43] <illustion> |x - m| <= 1/2 and |y - n| <= 1/2
[12:36.45] <_kmh_> personally I don't likethe Hilbert view seeing math as symbol manipulation only
[12:37.17] <illustion> then for |(x - m)^2 - 2(y - n)^2| <= 1/4 + 1/2 by triangle inequality right?

[12:37.23] <illustion> did I make any mistake here?
[12:37.27] <SpicSpackSpock> so can someone answer my question about the hedonistic calculus?
[12:37.48] <_kmh_> SpicSpackSpock,  yes but elegance is not defined by shorness as such, but shortness combined with clarity and acessibility
[12:40.33] * meoblast001 (~meoblast@dynamic-acs-24-112-206-77.zoominternet.net) Quit (Quit: Leaving)

[01:32.17] <SpicSpackSpock> It wouldn't be useful to you anymore, and you'd just be showing that your matrix has a trivial solution
[01:32.34] <SpicSpackSpock> which you don't really care about since your question is asking for all non-trivial solutions
[01:33.06] <SpicSpackSpock> hell multiply all rows by zero, now you have 0 = 0
[01:33.16] <SpicSpackSpock> congrats

[02:48.01] <Ozera> Er, the one in my question.
[02:48.06] <lieven> energy can neither be created nor destroyed so one way of seeing it is that the sun gives us kindly low entropy energy that we use and convert into high entropy energy that we radiate away as warmth. But ##physics for that
[02:48.22] <mr0everywhere> ok to my physics question, i have 2 weights suspended by a rope of no mass on a frictionless pully, weight 1(3 kg) is 1.5 m above the ground, weight 2(2kg) is on the ground. i have to find how fast weight 1 is moving when it hits the ground. I dont have the slightest idea where to begin with the math portion of this problem.

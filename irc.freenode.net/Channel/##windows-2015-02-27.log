[05:55.11] <ninjahatodi> Why do people knowingly install "Linux" and waste time? Just wondering why not use Windows and use that time watching porno
[05:55.14] <ninjahatodi> Why
[05:55.21] <ninjahatodi> Tell
[05:55.36] <ninjahatodi> Such a beautiful cock
[05:56.04] <ninjahatodi> Windows
[05:56.12] <Stryyker> We're not here to bash other OS, many in here use multiple OS. We talk about Windows here.
[05:56.33] <iNeophyte> Can I ask a question about Imgburn here?
[05:56.34] * Baronawesome_ (~Alphard@191.191.163.20) has joined channel ##windows
[05:56.48] <Stryyker> you can try
[05:58.43] <iNeophyte> Well I get this error when I try to validate the burned disk. ＋＋http://puu.sh/geKX7.png，，
[05:59.31] <Stryyker> It can be a sign of media issues, more likely writer is on the way out. How much work has the drive done?
[05:59.42] * Baronawesome (~Alphard@unaffiliated/baronawesome) Quit (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[05:59.55] <iNeophyte> A lot :x
[06:00.26] <Stryyker> Do you have access to another writer?
[06:00.26] <iNeophyte> Nope :(
[06:00.26] <iNeophyte> So it broke...?
[06:01.09] <Stryyker> Not as reliable as it was. You could try different burn speeds or media. For Windows you can often install via USB flash drive. I like to use Rufus to make such things.

[06:02.01] <aias> hello. i have a lenovo thinkpad x240 with two batteries (internal and usual slot in back style). when i charge them both from empty, first the internal fills to 80%, then the removable to 100%. the final 20% of the internal battery does not charge until i remove the removable battery and plug in
[06:02.24] * MrAlexanB (~MrAlexand@43.232.251.212.customer.cdi.no) has joined channel ##windows
[06:02.27] <iNeophyte> It is not safe to install windows with this dvd either then?
[06:02.34] <Stryyker> no
[06:02.37] <aias> anyone else experience this? perhaps this is a good thing for the batteries health...
[06:02.54] <Stryyker> I never trust/use/keep anything that fails the verify step.

[06:45.52] <Entalyan> That sounds like Chrome to me. Regardless of which OS though
[06:46.02] <SCHAAP137> Anyone here with a Surface Pro 3? How can I create a shortcut that leads directly to projecting on a wireless 2nd screen?
[06:46.10] <SCHAAP137> (desktop shortcut)
[06:46.46] <SCHAAP137> without any intermediate actions, just click and boom

[06:48.06] <Entalyan> Well it's already only 2 easy moves compared to the 8 it was before.
[06:48.22] <Entalyan> If you find a machine that can do it in 1 click by default, let me know
[06:48.41] <SCHAAP137> true, but it's unclear what is needed to do this in 1 move, it seems it's not calling an executable when performing this action
[06:48.57] <SCHAAP137> it's not transparent enough to see what's actually going on, that's not cool
[06:49.10] <Entalyan> It's a command, I can look it up if you want
[06:49.36] <SCHAAP137> If you can find it, that would be great

[11:52.32] <burnside> Xanather: in response to the financial crisis Chinese authorities promoted rapid growth loans and other lending activities. Given how reliant Australia was on China for trade markets, it doesn't seem too unsurprising that Australia's general asset prices didn't suffer as long as China was supporting some growth engine.

[03:24.46] <A_G1RL> weather effects economics
[03:24.51] <Mr0rris0> does it?
[03:24.53] <Mr0rris0> oh
[03:24.56] <Mr0rris0> :P
[03:24.57] <vonStrauss> climate does, I suppose
[03:25.15] <boxc> ain't no one buying anything on a rainy day
[03:25.17] <vonStrauss> but even so it doesn't effect it
[03:25.19] <vonStrauss> it affects it
[03:25.20] <boxc> especially not suede shoes
[03:25.34] <A_G1RL> sure, winter syndrome, sun, if the local climate is trying to kill humans, all a factor on their actions and therefore trading

[03:27.33] <A_G1RL> i do radio
[03:27.50] <Mr0rris0> theres a hamradio channel on freenode
[03:28.00] <ferros> You do what, A_G1RL?
[03:28.18] <Mr0rris0> probably means listen to radio ferros
[03:28.23] <Mr0rris0> that or shes a talk show host
[03:28.25] <A_G1RL> just a simple dj on the radio
[03:28.47] <ferros> as opposed to a complicated dj?
[03:28.55] <A_G1RL> well yes
[03:29.08] <A_G1RL> right now i pretty much just announce songs or postings
[03:29.42] <A_G1RL> but i'd like to get into playing indy music, go outside the box
[03:29.54] <Mr0rris0> even steven seagall was a simple chef, when shit hits the fan youll know how to take back that radio station

[03:30.25] <ferros> Good morning, it's a wonderful sunny morning in the Tristate area. I'm ferros and you're listening to 95 Hit Radio. Coming next is the new Radiohead song straight from the presses.
[03:30.25] <vonStrauss> wait um
[03:30.26] <A_G1RL> but it is just terrestrial radio - i've done global internet as well as live vid shows with tons of opinions
[03:30.31] <ferros> Will you hire me, A_G1RL?
[03:30.32] <vonStrauss> What causes boom bust cycles guys??
[03:30.50] <A_G1RL> hire yu for what?
[03:30.52] <boxc> vonStrauss: that's either a vastly complex question or a very simple one
[03:31.07] <ferros> For being a dj
[03:31.10] <vonStrauss> boxc: are central banks are governments the primary actors?
[03:31.17] <boxc> vonStrauss: my view is that the fed causes it... 
[03:31.35] <boxc> vonStrauss: i would say so, because they just keep pushing and pushing and pushing and tries to keep the economy moving upwards even when it's obvious it's getting weaker
[03:31.39] <boxc> and then eventually it just has to bust
[03:31.44] <A_G1RL> in most radio there is no hiring - you gotta make a show and then it attracts sponsors/advertisers and that is how you get paid
[03:31.44] <boxc> but
[03:31.45] <boxc> of course
[03:31.47] <boxc> millions of other factors
[03:31.48] <boz> vonStrauss: credit expansion outpacing the ability of firms to pay down debt
[03:32.18] <Mr0rris0> heard of pardo AG?

[03:33.04] <boxc> vonStrauss: but what really causes it is just the human psyche
[03:33.09] <Mr0rris0> good inspiration for me anyway, hes improv guy, has a gentleman schtick

[03:36.28] <vonStrauss> is it when people stuff money under their bed
[03:37.03] <vonStrauss> or stuff it in the dead cat's mouth half a metre underground in your backyard
[03:38.00] <boz> vonStrauss: whatever it is that causes people to think interest rates will go up

[03:39.46] <Mr0rris0> but on the whole of things, everyone preventing that causes some other thing?
[03:39.56] <vonStrauss> people not spending keeping their money in the bank is what a liquidity trap is?
[03:40.03] <vonStrauss> and hayekians think liquidity traps are good?/
[03:40.31] <boz> it's when savings are high and interest rates are low. it means monetary policy wont work

[03:46.34] <A_G1RL> in life you need stuff - you either work and make that stuff yourself, or you work for a tradable so that you can aquire that stuff
[03:46.43] * erwqsdefr (~izhxusioa@unaffiliated/erwqsdefr) has joined channel ##economics
[03:46.46] <vonStrauss> or someone gives you stuff like chirstine walton
[03:47.05] <anarkhos> ok, i came across One-Dimensional Man via marxists.org yesterday, and im curious about whether it's worthwhile getting through the 200-300 pages
[03:47.27] <A_G1RL> i prefer 3d
[03:47.31] <A_G1RL> or even 4
[03:47.43] <anarkhos> ha
[03:47.45] <vonStrauss> anarkhos: if you want to be a free marketist but not subscribe to a completely toxic ideology, view what milton friedman thought about the negative income tax
[03:47.45] <boz> in sam walton's book, he writes about how people would write to him and ask for the money to buy their dream home or their kids' education

[03:49.10] <ferros> Well, we have Captain Obvious :D
[03:49.54] <anarkhos> ferros: my shallow impression is that it concerns the manner in which people allegedly are repressed, manipulated by ideology. id assume capitalism is the main target, but marcuse was no apologist of soviet communism either

[03:52.57] <ferros> Althusser knew what he was talking about on ideology, I'm not really convinced about this one. But I may be wrong.

[08:22.21] <Euclide> Oh ok
[08:22.27] <Euclide> So Homer is a genius ?
[08:22.41] <Euclide> I would like be as intelligent as homer simpson ... lol
[08:22.49] <PlanckWalk> The other 34 digits are different

[08:26.18] <illustion> in their proof
[08:26.18] * profess (~profess__@unaffiliated/csddesk) has joined channel ##math
[08:26.24] <illustion> their is 1 point that I don’t understand

[08:26.41] * pred (~pred@wikipedia/pred) has joined channel ##math
[08:26.41] <illustion> how did we get this line here ?
[08:26.45] <illustion> could you explain ?

[08:28.07] <PlanckWalk> The first line in the algebraic part of the proof?
[08:28.19] * pspace (~bountyx@192-195-82-80.PUBLIC.monkeybrains.net) Quit (Quit: Peace and love.)
[08:28.26] <illustion> yeh
[08:28.38] <illustion> I don’t understand what did they do how did they get here
[08:28.53] <illustion> coz this point I am trying to proof this but I can’t reach that part of the proof
[08:29.00] <PlanckWalk> It's just an expression.  The reason behind it is stated later.
[08:29.23] <PlanckWalk> It would be nice if they numbered their equations <grumble>
[08:29.45] <sifeic> q
[08:29.46] * sifeic (~sifeic@c-75-71-117-103.hsd1.co.comcast.net) Quit (Quit: WeeChat 0.3.8)
[08:30.10] <PlanckWalk> If you read it backward, it makes more sense ;-)
[08:30.22] <PlanckWalk> You want to prove that [[a,b]]×[[c,d]]=[[p,q]]×[[r,s]]
[08:30.29] <illustion> yeh
[08:30.34] <illustion> exactly that is
[08:30.34] <PlanckWalk> Theat means proving that  [[ac+bd,ad+bc]]=[[pr+qs,ps+qr]]
[08:30.38] <illustion> they have the same expression
[08:30.39] <illustion> yeh
[08:30.48] * Sweet_Ride (~Sweet@162.212.119.0) Quit (Ping timeout: 246 seconds)
[08:30.51] <PJBoy> there's a mistake in there
[08:30.55] <PJBoy> I better correct it quick
[08:30.58] <PlanckWalk> Which means proving that   ac+bd+ps+qr=ad+bc+pr+qs
[08:31.29] <illustion> yes
[08:32.26] <PlanckWalk> Now you don't know very much about the variables other than  a+q=b+p and c+s=d+r
[08:32.38] <illustion> yeh
[08:32.47] <illustion> I thought I would multiply
[08:32.53] <illustion> (a + q)(c + s)
[08:32.54] <illustion> etc
[08:32.55] <PlanckWalk> So ideally you want an expression in which you have (a+q)c  instead of just ac
[08:33.02] <illustion> anto see if it get me somewhere
[08:33.06] <illustion> but it didnt
[08:33.06] * MulleDK20 (MulleDK19@unaffiliated/mulledk19) has joined channel ##math
[08:33.11] <illustion> yeh
[08:33.36] * duncannz (~duncannz@116.251.193.92) has joined channel ##math
[08:33.47] <PlanckWalk> So you start with an expression  in which you have each of those "extra" terms
[08:34.08] * slurik (~slurik@CPE00a0d197f29e-CM788df7fc0870.cpe.net.cable.rogers.com) Quit (Remote host closed the connection)
[08:34.45] <illustion> I see
[08:34.50] <PlanckWalk> So you have LHS + blah = (lots of algebra) = RHS + blah
[08:34.52] <illustion> and see where it leads us
[08:34.55] <PlanckWalk> Then you can use the cancellative property
[08:34.58] <illustion> yeh
[08:35.16] <illustion> I see I thought I could do it by construction somehow instead of doing this guessing game
[08:36.01] * MulleDK19 (~MulleDK19@unaffiliated/mulledk19) Quit (Ping timeout: 264 seconds)
[08:36.07] * MulleDK20 is now known as MulleDK109
[08:36.08] * MulleDK109 is now known as MulleDK19
[08:36.23] <illustion> it would be easier if we have for example a - b = p - q & c - d = r - s
[08:36.27] <illustion> then it would be direct
[08:37.36] * PJBoy (~PJBoy@unaffiliated/pjboy) Quit (Quit: ChatZilla 0.9.91.1 [Firefox 35.0.1/20150122214805])

[08:38.43] * a3Dman (~3Dman@unaffiliated/a3dman) has joined channel ##math
[08:38.52] <illustion> Planckwalk is their a way to see which variables we should add
[08:38.58] <illustion> in order to make equation work out
[08:39.26] * Euclide (58a2a2c7@gateway/web/freenode/ip.88.162.162.199) Quit (Ping timeout: 246 seconds)
[08:41.11] <PlanckWalk> illustion: Yes, there is.  Although you aren't allowed to use subtraction in the proof, you can use it to guide your proof
[08:42.23] * ammm (~chatzilla@85.64.247.83.dynamic.barak-online.net) Quit (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)

[08:43.21] * blight (~greg@reactos/developer/blight) Quit (Quit: Konversation terminated!)
[08:43.43] <PlanckWalk> After all, you don't "really" care that a+q = b+p, you "really" mean that a-b = p-q
[08:44.59] <PlanckWalk> The algebra there is just doing contortions to avoid subtraction
[08:45.11] * efm_ is now known as efm

[08:49.27] <btcbuy314> aa
[08:49.47] <btcbuy314> anyone know a good online 3d function plotter that can plot multiple equations on the same plot
[08:49.49] <PlanckWalk> Likewise what you 'really' want to prove is that (a-b)(c-d) = (p-q)(r-s)
[08:49.57] <illustion> yeh
[08:50.10] <btcbuy314> so i could put in equations including all variables x y and z
[08:50.13] <acg> if I have a direction (2, -3, 1), how do I represent the family of all directions that are related due to symmetry (cubic system)?
[08:50.23] <illustion> I mean with subtraction its direct
[08:50.37] <btcbuy314> not like f(x,y)  but like x^2+y^2+z^2 = 1 or something
[08:50.43] <PlanckWalk> Yep, so you take the direct proof, and add in all the terms you need to avoid subtraction
[08:50.55] <illustion> I see
[08:51.31] <PlanckWalk> So if you had  (a-b)(c-d) on one side, you get  ac-bc-db+bd, so add bc+db to both sides to avoid subtraction
[08:52.17] <illustion> I see
[08:52.20] <illustion> yeh makes sense
[08:52.23] * _X_C_V_B_ (~XCVB@dur-dhcp-1-117.dsl.airstreamcomm.net) Quit (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
[08:52.32] <PlanckWalk> Once you do all that and arrange it nicely, you get something much like the algebra in that page

[08:59.30] <byron2> the early objections from Poincare, Kronecker and others to Cantor's transfinite set theory, they all just sorta died out, eh?
[08:59.58] <lrs> How do i show that floor(2x)+floor(2y)=>floor(x)+floor(y)+floor(x+y)

[09:02.16] <Frejo> Can we express any first order ODE  as  f(y', y) =  something
[09:02.23] <Frejo> ?
[09:02.36] <Frejo> If yes, what is that something ?
[09:02.46] <stoopkid> Frejo: unless that something is for example y'', then it's a 2nd order ODE
[09:02.53] * ndndnd (~Hellmut@dsl-31-179.utaonline.at) Quit (Quit: Leaving)
[09:03.04] * samsama_ (~samsama@host-78-148-48-36.as13285.net) Quit (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
[09:03.12] <PlanckWalk> Frejo: You can make something = 0 if you want
[09:03.15] <benzrf> thanks cantor rip ;-;
[09:03.26] <Frejo> No, i think you didn't understand my question.  Suppose i have an arbitrary first order ODE, can i always possibly express it as  f(y',y) = something ?
[09:03.32] <Frejo> And in that case, would the something be a function of what ?
[09:03.43] <PlanckWalk> Oh wait, no you need the independent variable in f
[09:03.44] <Frejo> Obviously, the something can't be y'' because i'm assuming i have a first order Ode
[09:03.45] * ssbr_at_work (scorchsabe@python/site-packages/ssbr) Quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[09:03.56] <PlanckWalk> f(y', y, x) = 0

[09:04.20] <Frejo> ;(
[09:04.29] * profess_ (~profess@unaffiliated/csddesk) has joined channel ##math
[09:04.42] <Frejo> So, some first order ODEs wont possibly be expressed as f(y',y) = something
[09:04.51] <stoopkid> f(y', y, x) = g(y', y, x) is a first order ode, and g(y', y, x) could be 0
[09:04.58] * profess (~profess__@unaffiliated/csddesk) Quit (Quit: Leaving)
[09:04.59] * profess_ is now known as profess
[09:05.32] <PlanckWalk> Frejo: y' - x = 0  is a first-order ODE, for example.  A pretty trivial one, admittedly
[09:06.05] <stoopkid> Frejo: by definition a first order ODE is expressible as f(y', y, x) = g(y', y , x) --> f(y', y, x) - g(y', y, x) = 0 --> (f-g)(y', y, x) = 0
[09:06.13] <Frejo> yeah but in that case it can be expressed as  f(y',y) =  x

[09:07.39] <Frejo> Anyways, anyone know the motivation for calling some first order ODEs as linear ? Does it have antyhing to do with calling some usual equations as linear  such as  ax + by + cz = d

[09:08.18] * alienspy (alienspy@2600:3c00::f03c:91ff:fe84:cf6a) has joined channel ##math
[09:08.21] <Frejo> hmmm
[09:08.24] <PlanckWalk> I.e. if y1 and y2 are solutions to a linear ODE, then a y1 + b y2  is also a solution for arbitrary scalars a, b
[09:08.35] * kreiGT (~kreig@190.148.70.213) has joined channel ##math
[09:08.38] <Frejo> And the same reasoning applies to ax + by + cz = d   ?
[09:08.45] * alienspy (alienspy@2600:3c00::f03c:91ff:fe84:cf6a) Quit (Remote host closed the connection)
[09:08.46] <PlanckWalk> Not quite
[09:09.04] <Frejo> Yes,  but in a sense they are both classified as "linear equations"
[09:09.10] <Frejo> So i was expecting some kind of similarity
[09:09.15] <PlanckWalk> Yes, just a slightly different sense of linearity

[09:11.48] <Frejo> Need d=0 so that linear combination of solutions are also solutions
[09:11.51] <Frejo> right
[09:11.56] <Frejo> for the second one
[09:11.58] <stoopkid> Frejo: a function f(x) is linear if f(a*x + b*y) = a*f(x) + b*f(y)
[09:12.08] <Frejo> stoppkid Right

[09:12.40] <Frejo> But how do we relate that simple and nice idea to  Linear equations ( both linear diff equations and linear usual equations ) ?

[09:13.26] <PlanckWalk> You can think of functions as being a vector space

[11:38.32] <duckrabbit> Hello, Rainb. Could you spare a few minutes to talk?
[11:38.48] <Rainb> oh hello duck
[11:38.55] <Rainb> Sorry for not answering you the last time
[11:39.01] <Rainb> I was kinda afk
[11:39.03] <Rainb> Yeah, sure.
[11:40.20] <duckrabbit> I just want to be absolutely sure that you are interested in the friendship, that I am serious about the friendship, and how you want the friendship to be, or whether you wan to continue or end it.
[11:41.12] <duckrabbit> If it takes time to decide and think, I'll wait.
[11:42.57] <duckrabbit> You can also ask any personal questions if you want, and if you need the trans-technology now, I can push myself to do so.

[12:45.27] <Rainb> then I check

[12:45.37] <duckrabbit> as in the tutoring and trans-tech?

[12:49.52] <Rainb> it sucks tho
[12:49.58] <Rainb> time is consumed
[12:50.03] <Rainb> like double-speed
[12:50.09] <Rainb> it used to be slow and long
[12:50.10] <duckrabbit> what's atend his visit
[12:50.23] <Rainb> To receive him, to greet him, etc.
[12:50.29] <duckrabbit> i see
[12:50.31] <Rainb> to attend him
[12:50.33] <Rainb> I mean
[12:50.54] <Rainb> when someone in your family comes to visit you, you're the host, kinda
[12:51.08] <Rainb> so you have to "host" him, if that makes sense
[12:51.46] <duckrabbit> Ok will spanish transcription help you speed up your work now?
[12:52.09] <duckrabbit> i've figured it out

[01:33.24] <Rainb> spanish transcription, from audio to text?
[01:33.29] --NGC6205-- logged in with account (NGC6205)
[01:33.34] <Rainb> yes, that will help me review classes way faster
[01:33.47] <Rainb> it's like making a transcription of your clases
[01:33.47] <duckrabbit> ok I need to go in 12 minutes
[01:33.52] <duckrabbit> I will post a link here
[01:34.09] --santpython-- logged in with account (santpython)
[01:34.10] <Rainb> you say that in your college you record mostly everything
[01:34.11] <duckrabbit> you need two softwares
[01:34.16] <Rainb> and students can see everything
[01:34.20] <duckrabbit> audacity
[01:34.20] <Rainb> or download
[01:34.27] <duckrabbit> and voicemeter
[01:34.41] <duckrabbit> ＋＋https://speechlogger.appspot.com/en/，，
[01:34.45] <Rainb> I have audacity already, so I'll get voicemeter
[01:34.51] <duckrabbit> this is the most accurate transcription engine possible
[01:35.08] <duckrabbit> the sentences do not have punctuation (periods,etc) but the words are ok
[01:35.21] <duckrabbit> 60-90% accuracy
[01:35.36] <duckrabbit> follow the videos on the bottom of the page
[01:35.47] <Rainb> by the way, haven't you thought of transcribing your classes too? It might just help you too, methinks.
[01:36.01] <Rainb> Oh, there's a drucker book, it says, some people are listeners, and some people are readers.
[01:36.17] <duckrabbit> transcription does not help me because everything is equations
[01:36.23] <Rainb> Like, some people have it easy with text, others have it easy with audio.
[01:36.32] <Rainb> Oh.
[01:37.00] <duckrabbit> ok here's how it works
[01:37.17] <duckrabbit> you capture the mp3 file with your recorder
[01:37.21] <duckrabbit> install voicemeter
[01:37.35] <duckrabbit> play the mp3 file with audacity through voicemeter
[01:37.51] <duckrabbit> the webpage I gave you hears the voicemeter mp3 and transcribes it
[01:37.58] <duckrabbit> set the language output to spanish
[01:38.21] --Richdog-- logged in with account (Richdog)
[01:38.40] <Rainb> wait, wat
[01:38.49] <Rainb> so is voicemeter like a filter
[01:39.05] <duckrabbit> voicemeter allows audio to go from one program to another
[01:39.12] <duckrabbit> audio inside the computer
[01:39.28] <duckrabbit> because the transcriber does not do mp3 directly
[01:39.33] <duckrabbit> so you need to use sound
[01:39.41] <Rainb> ohh
[01:39.52] <duckrabbit> so audacity plays the mp3
[01:39.54] <duckrabbit> makes sound
[01:40.09] <duckrabbit> voicemeter takes that sound from audacity and gives it to the web page
[01:40.15] <duckrabbit> you have to use chrome for the webpage
[01:40.20] <duckrabbit> other browsers do not work
[01:40.26] <Rainb> voicemeter is like virtual audio cable
[01:40.28] <Rainb> fantastic.
[01:40.29] <duckrabbit> yes
[01:40.49] <duckrabbit> I'll be back in 8-12 hours, group project
[01:40.54] <Rainb> There's a software called: virtual audio cable
[01:41.15] <Rainb> It is weird, that software like this exists, but you never find it if you look for it directly on google
[01:41.21] <Rainb> I mostly get crapware.
[01:41.45] <Rainb> Alright, David. I am grateful for your time.

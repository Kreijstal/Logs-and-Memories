[12:26.25] <burnside> what's astounding to me is that it's not common lore that the 10yr real yield was negative for about 1.5 years
[12:27.17] <mondo_kims> you mean the breakeven rate?
[12:27.28] <mondo_kims> the math gets kind of messy when it comes to TIPS and negative rates.
[12:28.07] <burnside> no, just the traded yield
[12:28.23] * kerosene (~kerozene@unaffiliated/kerozene) Quit (Quit: o/)
[12:29.25] <hammond>  think one were to make a db of all the chess moves possible and store them and then let someone play against that machine, and the machine only made moves that lead to a win or a draw that machine would be unbeatable
[12:29.27] <burnside> I'm assuming that when people bid on the yield they knew it was negative. no?

[12:40.24] <mondo_kims> hammond: i don't think so.
[12:40.55] <mondo_kims> you can make a move where 90% of the AI's branches lead to a win or draw.
[12:41.10] <mondo_kims> and then you make the move that steers it to those 10% losses next turn.
[12:41.38] <mondo_kims> hammond: basically you want to solve chess and play using a rainbow table?
[12:42.00] <mondo_kims> try it with a simpler game first that doesn't have so many possibilities.

[12:48.33] <mondo_kims> vanguard.
[12:48.47] <mondo_kims> hammond: maybe even connect four.
[12:49.03] <mondo_kims> i think there's an unbeatable system for connect four.
[12:49.29] <mondo_kims> i don't even think you need to solve the game for it.
[12:49.57] <happyowl> mondo_kims: Ah cool, thanks. Vanguard seems to come up a lot!
[12:50.17] <hammond> i didn't do the math for each and every move, and the procesing time it would take a computer to go down all of them, and then store them, but yarr

[12:51.27] <+EconBot> Title: Solving chess - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia (at en.wikipedia.org)
[12:51.46] <mondo_kims> well someone thinks there's a way to do it.
[12:54.28] <burnside> "While laboratory diamonds are nothing new, technological leaps have allowed manufacturers to produce larger numbers of gem-quality stones cheaply, with traders able to attempt to pass them off as mined, or natural, stones."
[12:54.43] <burnside> didn't know that
[12:54.48] <hammond> lol that's a grim outlook
[12:56.12] <mondo_kims> who cares?
[12:56.24] <mondo_kims> there's no real reason for diamond prices to be high.
[12:56.52] <mondo_kims> precious gem quality diamonds could disappear tomorrow and it wouldn't matter much.
[12:58.08] <burnside> the reason is simply that people are willing to pay those prices
[12:58.21] <superposition> $
[12:58.34] <superposition> did gold ever recover?
[12:58.37] <superposition> !metals
[12:58.41] <mondo_kims> it would either need to compare some 10120 possible game variations, or have a "dictionary" denoting an optimal move for each of the about 1043 possible board positions.[4] It is thus theoretically possible to solve chess, but the time frame required (according to Shannon, 1090 years on a 1 MHz processor) puts this possibility beyond the limits of any "feasible" (as of 1950) technology.
[12:58.44] <+EconBot> superposition: Gold  1169.70 -2.45 Silver  16.03 -1.70 Platinum  1162.00 -1.62 Palladium  821.00 -0.85  @kitco (ask NY last - markets are closed)

[12:59.22] <superposition> superduper
[12:59.22] <vonStrauss> money market mutual funds they any good
[12:59.31] <burnside> I don't particularly align with paying for precious rocks or metals, it's undeniable that there exists a long running pattern of people indeed willing to buy them
[01:00.19] <mondo_kims> they're good if you want liquidity and (under circumstances that don't currently exist) enough yield to outpace inflation.
[01:01.04] <burnside> I think I read somewhere that the industry has moved to microetching the stones
[01:01.05] <mondo_kims> 2009 was the only time in history where the share price of money market funds dropped below a dollar, but if you withdrew, you'd still get $1 out for every share.
[01:01.10] <vonStrauss> every paper fiat currency has ended.
[01:01.13] <vonStrauss> GLD is still running big
[01:01.30] <vonStrauss> although metals are still fiat, to the extent they are faith based
[01:01.37] <burnside> the challenge is to convince people that mined or natural diamonds are more valuable than synthetic diamonds
[01:02.58] <burnside> you could probably rely on your industry best practices to do that. like, protecting the entire supply chain, etc.
[01:03.09] * mondo_kims shrugs
[01:03.22] <mondo_kims> people will always pay "for the real thing"
[01:04.02] <burnside> but once you rely on just managing the re-sale value, with microetching etc., you give up that "imposter" revenue and then have a whole new problem with counterfeit etchings
[01:04.21] <burnside> very interesting, though unoriginal, problem
[01:04.34] <vonStrauss> Can anyone tell me what happened September 2014 to trigger the OIL slump
[01:05.18] <emmeka> well
[01:05.35] <emmeka> I think the going theory is that OPEC got tired of having competition
[01:05.43] <emmeka> and so massively devalued the price of oil intentionally
[01:05.51] <emmeka> to push out producers with higher production costs than them
[01:06.29] <vonStrauss> I've heard it was due to the slowing down of brix nations
[01:06.30] <burnside> lol
[01:06.51] <burnside> dem brix!
[01:06.52] * emmeka waits to be corrected
[01:07.13] <burnside> emmeka: it would take too long for the full explanation
[01:07.28] <burnside> but the good news is that it's mostly all public information by now
[01:07.28] <emmeka> burnside was I close enough?
[01:07.41] <burnside> emmeka: a bit
[01:07.53] <emmeka> good enough for me
[01:08.50] <burnside> the last line is certainly true
[01:10.39] <emmeka> <vonStrauss> although metals are still fiat, to the extent they are faith based -- this is the thing I don't get
[01:10.45] <emmeka> people who rant about fiat currencies
[01:10.52] <emmeka> like, isn't gold a fiat currency?
[01:11.19] <vonStrauss> Yeah but the supply can't be adjusted purposefully
[01:11.29] <emmeka> FREE MARKET
[01:11.42] <vonStrauss> Arent you a free marxist?/
[01:11.53] * emmeka watches his currency value disintegrate as a new gold vein is discovered
[01:12.08] <emmeka> vonStrauss sure but it's fun to shout FREE MARKET very loudly at times
[01:12.20] <vonStrauss> I like to go into #mises and yell "FREE MARKET VALEUS"

[01:19.18] <emmeka> Bruce Springsteen is an icon of working class culture and he's done fuckloads of shit which is arguably very socialist
[01:19.45] <vonStrauss> sorry but he ain't a marxist.

[01:53.50] <burnside> The stress tests now, five years in, are just a part of U.S. bank capital regulation: Capital regulation now means that you're supposed to have at least X amount of capital now (on various measures), and at least Y amount in the Fed's annual severe stress scenario.

[02:04.34] <burnside> I thought that was the capital review
[02:05.49] <burnside> the stress tests are more war gaming capital adequacy for shocks
[02:06.36] <@wintax> I mean, it's all happening this month
[02:07.27] <@wintax> they submit a dividend + buyback proposal
[02:07.39] <greedo> well this is annoying

[02:09.57] <greedo> that is the stupidest idea ever
[02:10.04] <@wintax> yeah, they have to be in your county also
[02:10.15] <greedo> yeah, Kings
[02:10.23] <@wintax> what a lot of people do is claim Albany county first
[02:10.44] <@wintax> because the newspapers up there are significantly cheaper
[02:10.50] <greedo> this is a stupid law
[02:11.05] <burnside> what are you a child? It's standard practice for legal issues.
[02:11.07] <@wintax> then once they run the ad, switch back to kings or wherever
[02:11.25] <burnside> like if you foreclose on a lien, you have to advertise similarly
[02:12.06] <greedo> getting a company off the ground should not be made difficult like this
[02:12.19] <greedo> it's a barrier to entry
[02:12.26] <burnside> lol filing for an LLC is hardly difficult
[02:12.31] <@wintax> it's not too bad, just a bit of a pita
[02:12.50] <greedo> whatever
[02:13.00] <burnside> generally you hire an attorney. But for LLCs you can buy one of those kits or Google it or something.
[02:13.03] <greedo> I have 120 days still
[02:13.10] <@wintax> ask the papers to run, pay them, get the affidavit, give to secretary of state
[02:13.23] <@wintax> no need for attorney
[02:13.24] <greedo> yeah, legal zoom
[02:13.32] <@wintax> not even
[02:14.53] <hammond> it's beginning to look a lot like christmas
[02:15.18] <greedo> let's see $850 to publish in Kings County
[02:15.25] <@wintax> yeah lol
[02:15.36] <@wintax> I paid around $120 in Albany county
[02:15.47] <greedo> nice
[02:15.57] <greedo> newspapers there are cheap
[02:16.29] <@wintax> that's the point, times union was $60 or so iirc
[02:16.46] <hammond> i'm thinking of implementing some statistical learning using news data and see what can be gotten
[02:16.53] <burnside> that's just smart
[02:16.53] <@wintax> a lot of people do the switcharoo to save that $600-700
[02:16.59] <greedo> how much does it cost to switch back?
[02:17.05] <burnside> didn't think it would be that much of a difference
[02:17.36] <@wintax> I don't remember, just had to file an amendment with SoS

[02:18.36] <@wintax> yeah it's a big difference.  and that's just kings county
[02:19.43] <@wintax> hammond I win prizes more often than you run models
[02:19.52] <hammond> lol
[02:20.13] <@wintax> the annoying part is selling the prize to pay the taxes
[02:20.23] <mondo_kims> what prizes?

[02:22.11] <hammond> wintax, i bet i can put some price data in my app now and get the best future performing portfolio without lookng at the particular balance sheets
[02:22.29] <mondo_kims> so forward test it and see what you get.
[02:22.49] <mondo_kims> you said you're only going for the next month or so, right?
[02:23.35] <burnside> lol @ app
[02:24.04] <hammond> i forward tested one and it performed well, well no I can't do that yet, for a one month thing I would probably be selling some put 95% out of the money
[02:24.31] <mondo_kims> how well did it perform compared to an appropriate benchmark?
[02:25.04] <@wintax> what's that truism that everyone always says
[02:25.20] <@wintax> something about past performance not indicating future performance
[02:25.42] <greedo> yeah, it's annoying wintax
[02:25.58] <greedo> but whatever, I just have to roll with it now
[02:26.10] <@wintax> yeah :/
[02:26.20] <burnside> so repetitive, and yet, so forgotten
[02:26.28] <mondo_kims> i wouldn't really trust a strategy until it's outperformed in both a bull and bear cycle.
[02:26.53] <hammond> well today it's up 65%, since 2013
[02:27.22] <mondo_kims> buying individual stocks?
[02:27.53] <hammond> well I backtested it for 2008 annd 2007 and it went down, not as much as the market, yes i bought 10 shares and held
[02:28.19] <mondo_kims> does your system have anything to say about when to exit a position?
[02:28.37] <@wintax> back testing is going to overstate this strategy's merits significantly
[02:29.01] <@wintax> you pick the stock now, because of its performance up to now
[02:29.07] <mondo_kims> what are you saying, curve fitting to the past doesn't produce the best future results?
[02:29.08] <hammond> nope, i think I would just retest the market data a year after and make a new portfolio
[02:29.16] <@wintax> so when you back test, of course it's going to look good
[02:29.43] <mondo_kims> hammond: if you're not planning on holding stocks until the bitter end, you need to have a way to decide when you were wrong about them.
[02:29.49] <mondo_kims> because you're not going to get it right every time.
[02:30.13] <mondo_kims> you should know this, dealing with prbobilistic predictions.
[02:30.32] <greedo> I need to find the cheapest newspaper in all of kings county
[02:30.40] * apoplexy_da_boss (~whatupbra@CPE2cd05a1a8339-CMbc1401279700.cpe.net.cable.rogers.com) has joined channel ##economics
[02:30.45] <mondo_kims> greedo: for what?
[02:30.56] * mmealling (~mmealling@2601:0:a500:3d1:7dcc:b33a:b816:e0ec) Quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[02:31.04] <hammond> true, the thing is some stocks performed better like 80%-90% while others did 50 to 30, but the whole was justified
[02:31.13] <@wintax> he's doing the LLC filing newspaper ad run
[02:31.23] <mondo_kims> hammond: test it with other out of sample data.
[02:31.29] * mmealling (~mmealling@c-67-166-198-20.hsd1.ga.comcast.net) has joined channel ##economics
[02:31.36] <greedo> mondo_kims: what wintax said
[02:31.39] <mondo_kims> see if you can pick stocks with data from 1950-1960 for 1961 or something.
[02:31.49] <mondo_kims> oh.
[02:32.06] <hammond> I will
[02:32.21] <mondo_kims> and figure out a way to decide if you're wrong.
[02:32.44] <mondo_kims> you know, what if there's an accounting scandal at one of the stocks you pick and it falls by 90% before going out of business a year later?
[02:33.02] <greedo> like radioshack?
[02:33.11] <mondo_kims> there was no accounting scandal there.
[02:33.18] <mondo_kims> they were just resigned to death.
[02:33.25] <@wintax> worldcom yo
[02:33.28] <mondo_kims> they made zero attempt to change.
[02:33.37] <greedo> sad, I need a new electronics store
[02:33.50] <mondo_kims> for what, dumb phones and batteries?
[02:33.54] <hammond> and I just picked stuff from the SP500, the only bad place it's wrong was the 2008 fall, and the out of sample test was done during good times, 2013, 2014
[02:33.56] <@wintax> lol
[02:34.22] <greedo> radioshack did carry resistors and other electronic components
[02:34.29] <mondo_kims> getting radio controlled cars from radioshack WAS pretty awesome as a kid...
[02:34.37] * kyledr (~kyle@ip68-227-14-49.lv.lv.cox.net) Quit (Ping timeout: 246 seconds)
[02:34.44] <mondo_kims> greedo: their stock was like 20 years old and never sorted right.
[02:35.17] <greedo> actually Fry's was half decent
[02:35.20] <greedo> is*
[02:35.31] <@wintax> poor RadioShack
[02:35.34] <greedo> but I don't think there all any of those here
[02:35.48] <hammond> but yeah for one month things assuming a normal distribution, and selling otms for a 1 month period seems to be a good idea
[02:35.49] <@wintax> they had mucho off balance sheet leases
[02:35.56] * A_G1RL (~A_G1RL@unaffiliated/a-g1rl/x-129563) Quit (Ping timeout: 255 seconds)
[02:36.00] <@wintax> so equity is worthless
[02:36.18] <greedo> that is scary
[02:36.48] <greedo> operating leases for each year should be on the balance sheet
[02:37.00] <mondo_kims> hammond: gonna be picking up nickels infront of a steamroller?
[02:37.05] <@wintax> it's a choice each company can make
[02:37.15] <@wintax> operating lease or capitalize it
[02:37.23] <greedo> if you see 100, 100, 100, 800 operating leases on a balance sheet
[02:37.23] <@wintax> either way it's still disclosed
[02:37.45] <greedo> you should spread that 800 out
[02:37.58] <@wintax> it's a choice
[02:38.00] <burnside> lol
[02:38.30] <hammond> if it's possible to make money in the long term with low risk, then it's possible to do the same in the short term
[02:38.50] <emmeka> why
[02:38.52] <@wintax> lol
[02:38.57] <emmeka> how does that follow at all
[02:39.17] <@wintax> hammond thinks in linear progressions
[02:39.22] <mondo_kims> what's that gametheory thing...
[02:39.42] <mondo_kims> about how the person who's able to wait longer has more bargaining power and gets a better deal?
[02:39.48] <greedo> operating leases like that always worry me
[02:40.10] <burnside> it's not exactly the hardest thing in the world to make the base assumption regarding those OpLeases > 5 yrs, attach some discount rate, adjust the rental and interest expenses, etc.
[02:40.23] <greedo> yes burnside
[02:40.27] <mondo_kims> you know, like if you're lost in a desert and about to die of dehydration, i can sell you water at any price i like because i can afford to wait and you can't.
[02:40.28] <greedo> exactly
[02:40.57] <greedo> then you can calculate the future value from that
[02:40.58] <mondo_kims> wintax: did radioshack have supplemental data in their annual reports regarding leases?
[02:41.05] <burnside> it's like accounting 100. so there's no added value in making the finance department run bullshit numbers for balance sheet anxious creditors
[02:41.36] <@wintax> oh crap, emmeka is here
[02:41.49] <burnside> I think here's a great rule of thumb: if you're worried about some operating obligations as a credit risk, then you shouldn't be lending to the company, yo
[02:41.50] <greedo> I was using a cost of debt of 30% last night
[02:42.18] <greedo> since I was looking at Dow30 companies
[02:42.58] <greedo> but cost of debt by industry might be a better rule of thumb
[02:43.09] <@wintax> mondo_kims: iirc they had enough information to see that they were fucked, I don't recall specifics
[02:43.19] * mondo_kims shrugs
[02:43.22] <mondo_kims> so it's not an issue.
[02:43.26] <@wintax> yeah shrug
[02:43.32] <emmeka> wintax why the hate :(
[02:43.37] <greedo> that is what I was arguing yesterday about
[02:43.47] <burnside> lol cost of debt at 30% ?
[02:44.03] <@wintax> emmeka: in this off balance sheet accounting discussion, I was about to slam pensions
[02:44.28] <@wintax> no off balance sheet item is worse than a fucking pension
[02:44.34] <@wintax> :P
[02:44.44] <mondo_kims> it's a pretty high cost long term obligation.
[02:44.53] <greedo> numpy.npv(0.3, future_values)
[02:45.05] <mondo_kims> and if it's defined benefit instead of define contribution, you better hope things go well for like, maybe about forever.
[02:45.07] <greedo> = present_values
[02:45.36] <greedo> you can't do those kind of calculations with zack's data
[02:45.47] <greedo> they aggregate the numbers
[02:45.50] <mondo_kims> hm.
[02:45.58] <mondo_kims> business insider is basically buzzfeed at this point...

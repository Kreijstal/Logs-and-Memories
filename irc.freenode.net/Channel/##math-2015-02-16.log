[12:05.15] <MotivicScones> “FOIL” is the mathematical equivalent of a thought-terminating cliche — it can be mindlessly memorized and applied without any understanding of the distributive property, and often winds up acting as an obstacle to that understanding.
[12:05.30] * levite- is now known as Levite
[12:05.53] <t0astt> MotivicScones: Well, it wasn't so much the FOIL method, but I needed to figure out how to factor out that trinomial
[12:07.07] <MotivicScones> factoring is the opposite of distributing. if you’re looking for a general way to factor quadratic polynomials, completing the square is one such method.

[12:17.57] <anon_math> I have a question: How to classes of sets not run into the same russel paradox problems that sets of sets do?

[12:21.58] * Drew_ (~drew@108.92.102.111) has joined channel ##math
[12:22.07] <somiaj> it is more sets were redefined to not allow russel's paradox, so they had to create a new object which could be the blank of all sets. They then put a bunch of rulese on these objects called classes to keep them from falling into the same issue, such as the 'class of all classes'
[12:22.40] <somiaj> I belive categories are the more modern thing to talk about. But my knowledge is week in these parts

[12:23.46] <drazak> because a set isn't a class and sets cannot contain classes (or something) so the class of all sets doesn't contain itself
[12:24.03] <anon_math> Thanks somiaj that makes a lot of sense, It came up in a introduction to category theory. Thanks drazak.

[12:27.44] <@Cale> anon_math: It depends a little on what you mean by classes, but in one approach, classes are essentially just predicates with a single free variable ranging over sets. So you can't have classes whose elements are classes. The elements of a class are just the sets which satisfy the condition.

I need help taking in to account the wind. You don't even have to answer the question itself, I just need some help with the general idea. I don't see how the wind would even affect the plane, considering it's moving away from the wind.

[12:33.31] <`Eddie> wait nvm
[12:33.31] * illustion (~Mr@static24-89-78-232.r.rev.accesscomm.ca) has joined channel ##math
[12:33.35] <illustion> hey guys
[12:33.42] <anon_math> DanOpi: so you make an constructive proof - for any and evry  irrational x and y you find a z between them (their average) which you prove to be irrational too
[12:34.00] <anon_math> DanOpi: therefore the irrationals are dense
[12:34.16] <t0astt> Can someone explain the step that I labeled "how" in this picture? I can't figure out how my professor got from the first step to the second. ＋＋http://i.imgur.com/0LARQLU.jpg，，
[12:34.35] <DanOpi> Why are x and y irrational?
[12:34.51] <@Cale> t0astt: Just factoring out (k+1)^2 from each term
[12:35.13] <anon_math> DanOpi: by presupposition, x and y are just some elements from the set of irrationals
[12:35.18] <@Cale> t0astt: Try going in the opposite direction by multiplying the (k+1)^2 through the bracket
[12:35.35] <DanOpi> Oh from the first lin e
[12:35.46] <anon_math> DanOpi: the point is that given two such elemenst, any two, you can find another between them

[12:36.44] <DanOpi> Okay
[12:37.24] <t0astt> Cale: Thanks, I'll try that!
[12:37.31] <DanOpi> So assume X and Y are irrational
[12:38.01] <DanOpi> So then X + Y and XY are irrational too
[12:38.05] <DanOpi> ?
[12:38.27] <DanOpi> I mean X + Y / 2
[12:38.28] <@Cale> DanOpi: sqrt(2) * sqrt(2)
[12:38.28] * Agent_Smith1 (~root@68-184-220-249.dhcp.stls.mo.charter.com) has joined channel ##math

[12:39.00] <DanOpi> Or not
[12:39.18] <Agent_Smith1> is there another way to write (r)/(1+t)
[12:39.26] <Agent_Smith1> can you split it up
[12:39.44] <@Cale> Also, adding  sqrt(2) and 2 - sqrt(2), both of which are irrational, will get you 2, which is rational

[12:40.40] <DanOpi> Not connecting the dots here
[12:41.00] <@Cale> (I don't know the context)
[12:41.10] <anon_math> Cale is disproving that X + Y is irrational when X and Y are irrational

[12:45.02] <DanOpi> How would i start the proof?
[12:45.04] <Agent_Smith1> anyone know this
[12:45.10] <@Cale> DanOpi: Start with two distinct rational numbers and find an irrational number between them
[12:45.32] <DanOpi> 1 and 2
[12:45.38] <DanOpi> Sqrt(3)
[12:45.46] <@Cale> DanOpi: No, two *arbitrary* rational numbers
[12:46.00] <@Cale> So, given q and q' rational numbers with q < q', say
[12:46.09] <@Cale> Find an irrational number between q and q'

[12:47.37] * rigor789|away is now known as rigor789
[12:47.42] <@Cale> Well, okay, let's start with q = 0 and q' = 1
[12:48.27] <DanOpi> OKay
[12:48.30] <@Cale> Remember that you can multiply an irrational number by any rational amount, and get another irrational number.
[12:48.42] <@Cale> and you can add any rational number to an irrational, and get an irrational
[12:48.55] <DanOpi> Correct
[12:49.05] <DanOpi> So an irrational between q and q' in this case?
[12:49.19] <@Cale> This should help you scale and translate the irrational number you found between 0 and 1 so that it lies in the range between q and q'
[12:49.37] <@Cale> (for arbitrary q and q')
[12:50.09] <DanOpi> ...
[12:50.16] <@Cale> arbitrary *rational* q and q'
[12:50.25] <DanOpi> >.< still lost
[12:50.39] <DanOpi> May just need to do it tomorrow.  I'm dead tired
[12:50.43] <@Cale> okay

[12:51.06] <@Cale> Play around with it a bit and shoot me a message if you can't make progress after a while I guess.
[12:51.12] <DanOpi> So i have two rational numbers... q and q'
[12:51.37] <DanOpi> And with the info i was given i need to use an irrational number somewhere in here

[12:52.18] <@Cale> DanOpi: Yeah, since if you're given two arbitrary distinct real numbers x and y, you can find a pair of distinct rational numbers q and q' which are both between x and y
[12:52.23] <koro> I had this question, in case anyone cares tonight: is it true that in a closed hyperbolic riemann surface the diameter of an open simply connected set is equal to the diameter of its boundary?
[12:52.46] <@Cale> and then if you can find an irrational number between those q and q', it'll also be between x and y
[12:52.56] <@Cale> That's the overall plan

[12:56.12] <Sparrk> can you teach me a little more about y = mx + b type equations
[12:56.19] <Sparrk> like transposing it to make it different?
[12:56.23] <somiaj> Sparrk: curve fitting I woudl'nt raelly call algebra, algebra is more how you can mainpulate symbolic expressions or equations.

[12:58.01] <somiaj> well you basically have two things to find both m and b, and how you find them depends on what you have.
[12:58.31] <Sparrk> so how do you find b first? ... I think that's the trick
[12:58.41] <somiaj> I preefr the equation (y - y1) = m(x - x1) as the equation of a line given you know the slope m, and a single point it passes though (x1,y1) -- but either way I like to think that to find an equation of a line you need to know two independent bits if info.
[12:58.55] <somiaj> it depends on what you are given. Give an example, what do we know about this line we want to find.
[12:59.27] <Agent_Smith1> what's a trig function for sin - cos
[12:59.32] <Sparrk> three points, (0, 0), (2 , 5) (3, 6)
[12:59.32] <Agent_Smith1> -1?
[01:00.27] <somiaj> Sparrk: those poitns don't all lie on a single line, so there is no line equation that will hit all three fo them
[01:01.06] <somiaj> Agent_Smith1: there is a method you can use to write a sum of sine cosine waves as a single wave. i.e. Asin(x) + Bcos(x) = ksin(x + phi)
[01:01.14] <Sparrk> somiaj, do you know this by plotting the points? or do you plug into this or that equation?
[01:01.56] <Sparrk> is there like an invariant equation that will make (y - y1) = m(x - x1) fail to prove that these points do not in fact lie on a single line?
[01:02.30] <Sparrk> if I could teach my computer what it means to have 3 points that do not lie on a single line
[01:03.01] <Sparrk> given 2 or 3 points it would beep back telling me these points do or do not lie on a single line

[01:07.47] <Sparrk> ?define natural number
[01:07.55] <Sparrk> OH
[01:08.25] <somiaj> How would you define a natural number?
[01:08.27] <Sparrk> 4.506 does it have a ratio a/b == 4.506? if not it's irrational
[01:08.39] <Sparrk> a natural number is not floating point
[01:08.43] <Sparrk> no decimal place
[01:08.56] <`Eddie> anyone know a website on which i could graph vector functions?
[01:09.01] <somiaj> well what you would have to do is find a way to write it as a fraction of integers, but think about powers of 10, 4506/1000 = ?
[01:09.11] <Sparrk> OH
[01:09.15] <Sparrk> so it's a rational number
[01:09.19] <somiaj> `Eddie: sagemath has an online notebook and cloud you can use.
[01:09.58] <`Eddie> can you elaborate a bit?

[02:03.41] <spudzee1111> yup*
[02:03.51] <lyxia> wlczkun: That would make [0,1] disconnected.

[02:04.36] <lyxia> [a,b) is neither open nor closed. clopen means both open and closed.
[02:04.38] <spudzee1111> my question is this: if I have the complex number 0.5 + 0.7i how would I evaluate this on the mendelbrot set. Just explain that and I’ll be set to reproduce the results myself.

[02:04.59] <lyxia> wlczkun: no you can't
[02:05.04] <Cale> grill: Well, if you're trying to show that when A is regular, then so is D_x(A), you're effectively given a DFA for A, and you try to modify it somehow to turn it into a DFA for D_x(A)
[02:05.08] <tac_> wlczkun: You could, for instance, take a point x on the boundary of one of the open sets
[02:05.17] <tac_> They will cause you problems

[02:05.31] * rigor789|away is now known as rigor789
[02:05.37] <wlczkun> lyxia: is {1/2} clopen
[02:05.44] <tac_> because by definition, they live inside one open set or the other, and when you "wiggle" it, it will cross between the two, since it's on the boundary
[02:05.49] <lyxia> wlczkun: How so?
[02:05.55] <Cale> grill: Similarly, if you're assuming that A is context-free and you want to show that D_x(A) is as well, you can assume that you're given a pushdown automaton for A, and try to tweak it somehow to turn it into one for D_x(A)

[02:11.06] <Cale> What's D(A)?
[02:11.10] <lyxia> spudzee1111: To empirically find whether b belongs to the Mandelbrot set you can iterate f starting from 0 a couple of times and see whether the complex modulus of the result |f(f(...f(0)...))| is large.
[02:11.18] <spudzee1111> yes yes
[02:11.28] <lyxia> spudzee1111: So what's the problem?
[02:11.33] <Cale> also, you're not given the NFA for D_x(A), that's what you're trying to make out of the NFA for A
[02:11.40] <spudzee1111> but what if it’s a complex number, such as 0.5+0.7i ?
[02:12.03] <spudzee1111> tell me how I would know if that goes to infinity or if it stays bounded.

[03:27.01] <grill> so uh, can we just say that since regular languages are closed under concatenation, but because of this special case, the concatenation of these languages doesn't end up as regular. HOWEVER, since we know that certain tools used to define CFLs (ahem, CFGs) can be used to count the length of strings, this language (that would otherwise be regular if not for the length bit) is able to be defined

[11:03.02] <athan> I'm trying to make a system where, say I have a set of flags, then I allow a user to pick one of the flags in the set. Then, I allow them to pick two non-duplicate flags from the set (but no less or no more). Then, three out of the set. I'm just trying to figure out how something like this looks mathematically

[11:16.09] <athan> nicoo: Yes you're entirely correct, I'm just not sure if this exclusion connection would form a join semilattice at least

[11:17.26] <athan> hmm
[11:17.29] <lyxia> Do20: \mathbb{Q} writes Q.
[11:17.44] <Do20> \qq is easier in Latex haha
[11:18.01] <athan> I'm just trying to think of an efficient data representation in haskell lyxia :)
[11:18.05] <lyxia> you can define a macro then Do20

[11:18.27] <Do20> define a macro?
[11:18.37] <athan> \newcommand pretty sure :)
[11:18.47] <ceacy> I have a (simple?) question about convex programming (related to density estimation)... Basically, I am given explicitly a probability distribution over {1,...n,} (or, equivalently, a vector in the n-dimensional simplex Delta_n), and want to compute the closest (inL_1 norm) vector which is log-concave
[11:19.09] <ceacy> i.e. a vector (p_1,...,p_n) in Delta_n satisfying p_i^2 >= pI{i+1}p_{i-1}

[11:20.05] <ceacy> @athan. Nice. I never managed to get exclamation marks on my chin.
[11:20.17] <athan> It's gonna be a fad
[11:21.37] <athan> why `1`, ceacy?
[11:21.41] <athan> You don't want a limit?
[11:22.04] <lyxia> athan: efficient is relative to what operations you would want to support
[11:22.24] <athan> hoop, or is this in the enumerated dimensions of the vector? Sorry :\
[11:22.39] <ceacy> What do you mean? (basically, I'm trying to see how I could solve this optmization problem efficiently, e.g. by casting it as a convex program)
[11:22.49] <athan> lyxia: Just a type-correct representation...
[11:22.54] <Do20> There I changed it.  ＋＋http://mathb.in/27627，，

[11:24.31] <athan> but making 2 choices in the set that are not equal to each other, or like the way you calculated above, would be a correct one (or simpler, at the runtime level, two choices that are not "equal")

[01:07.48] <Dann20> This is my first proof course
[01:08.18] <antonfire> You try concrete examples until you know how to do it in general, and then you know how to do the proof. Not the other way around.
[01:08.44] <antonfire> _especially_ if you're not terribly familiar with proving things.
[01:08.50] <Dann20> 1/Sqrt(2)
[01:08.51] <Dann20> ?
[01:08.55] <Dann20> Between 0 and 1
[01:08.58] <Gilly> Dann20: one cute theorem: A number is rational if and only if its decimal expansion is eventually periodic.
[01:09.13] <Dann20> I know that much!  :D
[01:09.20] <antonfire> do you know how to prove it?
[01:09.27] <Z-module> Ozera: did you get your confirmation earlier? If x^n + c_1 x^(n-1) + ... + c^n has complete set of roots r_1, ..., r_n, then r_1 + ... + r_n = -c_1  [simple to show], which is why the set of all complex nth roots of 1 add up to 0. But more simply: those roots are equally spaced around the unit circle: every finite set of equally spaced points on an origin-centered circle has sum 0.
[01:09.32] <antonfire> because I expect that is a fact you are not "allowed" to use.
[01:09.38] <ubernoob12> Dann20, any interval contains uncountable many points, only countably many of them can be rational, so we are still left with uncountablt many irrational points
[01:10.09] <Z-module> (n > 1, I meant at the beginning)
[01:10.23] <Dann20> That makes sense ubernoob12
[01:10.50] <Gilly> the problem is that the fact that an interval contains uncountably many points needs a nasty cantor proof or similar
[01:10.59] <rudi91> being uncountable doesn't imply being dense
[01:11.04] <ubernoob12> yeah infact you can say that any interval on real line of non-zero length contaons uncountably many irrational points
[01:11.10] <Z-module> yes Dann20, 1/sqrt(2) is between 0 and 1. Can you now use that to find an irrational in the interval [n, n+1], for each integer n ?
[01:11.15] <antonfire> rudi91: nobody said it did
[01:11.38] <Dann20> I think so...
[01:11.40] <antonfire> being the complement (in the real numbers) of countable set does imply being dense
[01:11.52] <rudi91> i read ubernoob12's answer as an answer to Dann20's question

[01:16.03] <Z-module> right
[01:16.10] <Dann20> Which i can use
[01:16.17] <simono> hey how do i write "log to the base of 2" on a calculator?
[01:16.34] <rwiggins> simono: log(123098)/log(2)
[01:16.51] <Z-module> simono: it might have an "lg" key; if not, use  log(x)/log(2)   using whatever log key you do have (the base won't even matter)
[01:16.53] <drazak> or if you can prove that sqrt(n) is irrational for a specific n, you could pick say, sqrt((107)^2 + 1)
[01:16.54] <rwiggins> search for "change of base formula"

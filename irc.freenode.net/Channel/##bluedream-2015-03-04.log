[09:57.35] <bluedream> OldCoder hello  
[09:58.50] <OldCoder> Hi
[09:58.55] <OldCoder> I did not finish
[09:59.06] <OldCoder> about the wifi over power
[09:59.22] <OldCoder> If your room is on the same electrical circuit
[09:59.24] <OldCoder> as the router
[09:59.27] <OldCoder> it is worth a try
[09:59.36] <OldCoder> Cost is about $55 to $75
[09:59.40] <OldCoder> What happens is
[09:59.53] <OldCoder> You get a device, should not need any software
[09:59.56] <OldCoder> goes into router room
[10:00.02] <OldCoder> One cable plugs into router
[10:00.13] <OldCoder> Other plugs into power socket in wall
[10:00.13] <OldCoder>  
[10:00.23] <OldCoder> In your room, you have another such device
[10:00.29] <OldCoder> One cable plugs into power socket
[10:00.42] <OldCoder> Other plugs into... I think, Ethernet; not sure
[10:00.42] <OldCoder>  
[10:00.55] <OldCoder> Find out if power in the two rooms is on the same circuit
[10:01.05] <OldCoder> If so, get one of these things from Best Buy
[10:01.10] <OldCoder> SAVE THE RECEIPT for return
[10:01.11] <bluedream> its just strange instead of always drops me now it will work for a good while then start to act up almost like hiccups
[10:01.11] <OldCoder>  
[10:01.22] <OldCoder> And Windows does not hiccup when you try it?
[10:01.25] <OldCoder> At the same time?
[10:01.27] <bluedream> nope
[10:01.32] <OldCoder> May be marginal
[10:01.39] <OldCoder> what does signal strength look like?
[10:02.12] <bluedream> 53% right now
[10:02.55] <OldCoder> That is pretty good
[10:03.04] <OldCoder> Is the dropping happening tonight?
[10:03.07] <bluedream> its gone a few hours now i'm running it on the netgear dongle 
[10:03.35] <bluedream> no not so far was a little bit this afternoon when i got off work
[10:03.35] <OldCoder> Has that helped in general?
[10:03.42] <bluedream> i think so 
[10:03.49] <OldCoder> I have TWO suggestions
[10:03.50] <OldCoder> to try
[10:03.58] <OldCoder> Go downstairs
[10:04.06] <OldCoder> Go back to internal wifi
[10:04.17] <OldCoder> See if wifi holds steady
[10:04.22] <OldCoder> This is just to diagnose
[10:04.25] <OldCoder>  
[10:04.31] <OldCoder> Go close to room with router
[10:04.39] <OldCoder> Try for a couple of hours
[10:04.40] <OldCoder>  
[10:04.43] <bluedream> this is a good idea 
[10:04.43] <OldCoder> If it works, may be wifi
[10:04.47] <OldCoder> Despite Windows working
[10:04.50] <OldCoder> In this case,
[10:05.01] <OldCoder> ask parents if the two rooms are on the same electrical circuit
[10:05.01] <OldCoder>  
[10:05.03] <OldCoder> If they might be
[10:05.15] <OldCoder> Go to Best Buy and buy the device I described

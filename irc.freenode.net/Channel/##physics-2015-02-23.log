[12:46.21] <superposition> is the line at rest in T=1?
[12:46.25] <spudzee1111> no
[12:46.36] <spudzee1111> I just want to know where it is at t=1
[12:46.44] <superposition> that's geometry
[12:46.45] <spudzee1111> obviously it will continue to move
[12:46.58] <superposition> has nothing to do with how much force results in what angle
[12:47.09] <spudzee1111> I don’t understand
[12:47.14] <superposition> it's pure geometry
[12:47.21] <superposition> you can find theta without calculating any forces.
[12:47.48] <spudzee1111> theta is not moving until the force is applied at t=0
[12:47.53] <spudzee1111> burrr
[12:47.55] <spudzee1111> not theta
[12:47.59] <spudzee1111> ignore that last comment
[12:48.13] <spudzee1111> the line isn’t rotating until a force is applied at t=0
[12:48.53] <superposition> and the line will keep moving, and theta will keep changing, until it comes to rest at some point in the future beyond T=1
[12:49.06] <spudzee1111> yes
[12:49.24] <spudzee1111> but I don’t care about beyond t=1
[12:49.29] <spudzee1111> I care about t=1
[12:50.50] <spudzee1111> does my question make sense? I wouldn’t think the answer would be that complicated.
[12:51.07] * kreiGT (~kreig@201.216.140.134) Quit (Remote host closed the connection)
[12:51.13] <superposition> no it doesnt
[12:51.18] <spudzee1111> kk
[12:51.24] <spudzee1111> let me try to explain a bit
[12:51.38] <superposition> for any equation, the sum of the forces have to balance
[12:52.00] <superposition> you're telling me it's still moving, so you have to analyze that inertial frame
[12:52.11] * dk0r_ (~dk0r@unaffiliated/dk0r) has joined channel ##physics
[12:52.21] <superposition> but you wont say what the force is, what the line is, or what resistive forces there are
[12:52.29] <dk0r_> what's the name of that site frequently used in this chann to draw together?
[12:52.34] <superposition> which is why I'm telling you absent all those, it's a geometry problem
[12:53.49] <spudzee1111> I’m just trying to find a ratio, not a specific answer to a specific problem.
[12:54.17] * CvP (CvP@203.76.123.238) Quit (Read error: No route to host)
[12:54.29] <spudzee1111> fuck I just noticed the typ
[12:54.32] <spudzee1111> typo*
[12:54.33] <spudzee1111> fss
[12:54.35] <spudzee1111> ffs
[12:54.45] <spudzee1111> for fucking fuck sakes. I can’t spell anything right today
[12:54.52] * norkle (~norkle@unaffiliated/norkle) has joined channel ##physics
[12:54.55] * CvP (CvP@203.76.123.238) has joined channel ##physics
[12:55.08] <spudzee1111> I hate seeing a type in my diagram :(
[12:55.35] <superposition> okay, the ratio you're looking for is based on the weight of the line.
[12:55.42] <spudzee1111> yes
[12:55.48] <spudzee1111> for purposes, just assume it’s 1 kg
[12:55.52] <spudzee1111> well
[12:55.54] <spudzee1111> mass
[12:55.57] <spudzee1111> mass is 1 kg
[12:57.18] * thang1 (~thang@74-85-82-130.wallawalla.edu) Quit (Quit: thang1)
[12:57.33] <spudzee1111> okay, I don’t think I ever explicitly said this, but the force being applied to the far right of the line is not from gravity. It could be like a finger pressing upon the edge of a pen or something.
[12:57.41] <superposition> it's roughly analogous to a cantilever.
[12:57.42] <superposition> ＋＋http://engineering-references.sbainvent.com/strength_of_materials/shear-and-moment-diagrams.php，，
[12:58.41] <spudzee1111> fuck
[12:58.44] <spudzee1111> ＋＋http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lever，，
[12:59.24] <superposition> right
[12:59.26] <spudzee1111> that’s what I was looking for all along.
[12:59.46] <spudzee1111> ffs, this is like shit you learn in 5th grade
[12:59.47] <superposition> <superposition> so, you are being asked to generalize a singly-loaded lever?
[12:59.58] <superposition> -.-
[01:00.12] <spudzee1111> and I’m over here already solving the schrodinger equation for a hydrogen atom :(
[01:01.17] <spudzee1111> My physics knowledge has gaps...
[01:02.38] <superposition> master the basics before going into quanta
[01:02.57] <spudzee1111> But I can understand (thus far) the quanta...
[01:03.05] <spudzee1111> classical mechanics confuses the fuck out of me
[01:03.11] <spudzee1111> but...
[01:03.36] <xihr> QM heavily relies on some of the mature obtuse and confusing parts of CM, so you're going to have a bit of a problem there ...
[01:03.43] * foreignFunction (~ai@ip-4761.sunline.net.ua) has joined channel ##physics
[01:04.31] * blablaa (~z@unaffiliated/blablaa) Quit (Quit: Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[01:04.56] <spudzee1111> Generally speaking, the more math and less,”that’s just the way it is” a physics concept is, the easier it is for me to understand.
[01:07.17] <superposition> working with physical objects is another approach to developing an intuitive grasp of classical force relationships.
[01:07.30] <superposition> *to = towards, I guess
[01:08.08] * greenbagels (~gb@cpe-24-93-214-22.neo.res.rr.com) Quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[01:09.25] <spudzee1111> part of the issue is that I don’t know what I don’t know. So I can’t tell if there exist some part of physics I haven’t learned about yet.
[01:10.42] <spudzee1111> I’m sure there are plenty, I just haven’t found em yet.

[01:12.27] <xihr> huh?
[01:13.58] * xihr boggles
[01:14.24] <spudzee1111> I mean like, I didn’t know about all this amazing lever shit until now. And it’s not necessarily that I have a hard time understanding it. It’s more like I didn’t know it existed.

[01:30.46] * fireballs (~fireballs@128.135.100.111) has joined channel ##physics
[01:35.18] <baus> for the next couple of years the LHC will run at double power to try and understand supersymmetry
[01:35.31] <baus> how do the physicists know that won't destroy the earth?
[01:36.17] <superposition> math
[01:36.22] <mrdata> baus, cosmic ray events are greater energy than thaqt
[01:36.26] <mrdata> and we're still here
[01:37.03] <baus> idk seems selfish to me
[01:37.04] <xihr> far greater
[01:37.16] <superposition> the LHC seems selfish?
[01:37.29] <xihr> good use of logic
[01:37.38] <baus> i hope that they don't find data to corroborate supersymmetry
[01:37.46] <baus> and have to rethink all their theories
[01:37.56] <superposition> thats not what that would mean.
[01:37.59] <baus> like the standard model
[01:38.50] <xihr> it would not do that, SUSY is on top of the SM
[01:40.17] <baus> if they still don't find supersymmetry, they're just going to run it at higher power
[01:40.29] <xihr> ...
[01:40.29] <baus> until they do find it or destroy the earth
[01:40.37] * Viper168_ is now known as Viper168
[01:40.41] <xihr> you've already been told why it will do no such thing

[05:31.29] <blablaa> "Soldiers and officers receive awards for combat. It is an absolutely identical situation for us, because war is now moving to the area of journalism. This fact is absolute and you can't argue with it."
[05:31.39] <blablaa> clear thinking! :)
[05:32.47] <Cust0sL1men> source ?
[05:33.12] <blablaa> Cust0sL1men, Andrei Kondrashev as reported by RFE/RL
[05:34.17] <blablaa> "Television journalism has transformed as a whole and the standards of media organizations that we once considered our models have shifted to an area that you call 'propaganda' today. We have simply adopted the same methods that they [BBC and CNN] use today."
[05:34.52] <blablaa> Cust0sL1men, he keeps applying the principle of give one truth but always with another self serving lie.
[05:35.02] <Cust0sL1men> ;)
[05:35.07] <Cust0sL1men> so he wants a medal ?
[05:35.14] <blablaa> so, they're total liars, but "the evil westerns are the same"
[05:35.21] <blablaa> hehe
[05:35.40] <Cust0sL1men> can't he buy one at the corner shop ? maybe one of those chocholate medals ? and maybe a gold star to put on his forehead ?

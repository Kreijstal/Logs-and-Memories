[07:38.21] Channel Created on: 8:42 PM 1/29/2010
[07:38.23] <Twey> When constructing a free group over some set X, does one have to include the inverses of the elements of X explicitly, or is it allowed to have the elements be self-inverse?
[07:38.44] <Rainb> wait a second
[07:39.03] --Nazgul-- logged in with account (Nazgul)
[07:39.03] <lyxia> Twey: the inverse of an element is another element.
[07:39.05] <Ouroboros> Cale: do you have a good motivation for "subcountable" ?
[07:39.08] <Rainb> so cuberoot is not equal to exp(1/3,ln(x))
[07:39.21] <Rainb> exp(1/3*ln(x)) 
[07:39.24] * maqr (~maqr@httpcraft/hax) Quit (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[07:39.35] <Cale> Twey: The inverses are separate
[07:40.04] <Twey> lyxia, Cale: Why does that have to be the case?  It seems that having elements be self-inverse (i.e. abbc reducing to ac) also gives a group, which has less structure
[07:40.08] <Cale> Twey: Your group won't be free if there are any relations on the images of the elements of X other than those imposed by the group axioms
[07:40.23] <dispersed> kleister: you can imagine just splitting the interval always, name on of those 1, the other 0.. then it's the same as your model
[07:40.52] * kielybunny (bunny@systemd.violates.me) Quit (Quit: synapse)
[07:41.14] * disorder20 (~m3l720@78-134-59-109.v4.ngi.it) has joined channel ##math
[07:41.22] <Twey> Cale: Including equality?
[07:41.23] <dispersed> I think there is a problem using only 0 and 1 information theoretically since you cannot express sub-bit amount of information exactly... or you have to really go to infinity
[07:41.28] * disorder20 is now known as kkuno
[07:41.37] <Cale> Twey: The idea is that you have the "first" such group G in the sense that for any other group H and function X -> H, you have a unique group homomorphism G -> H such that the triangle formed by X -> G, X -> H and G -> H commutes.
[07:41.58] <dispersed> but that would mean even trivial programs which carry sub-bit amounts of information would be infinite
[07:41.58] * esas (~esas@unaffiliated/esas) Quit (Ping timeout: 264 seconds)
[07:42.19] <dispersed> (let's say, irrational amounts of information)
[07:43.11] <Twey> Cale: Hm, I think I see
[07:43.32] * Bantalon (~Bantalon@c83-251-39-36.bredband.comhem.se) has joined channel ##math
[07:43.34] <dispersed> so, your program would need more information, than what it is expressing
[07:44.14] <Twey> Using self-inverse elements in G would break that homomorphism because the elements may not be self-inverse in H
[07:44.28] <Cale> Twey: exactly
[07:44.42] <Twey> Alright, thanks ☺
[07:45.25] * ystael (~ystael@209-6-53-93.c3-0.smr-ubr1.sbo-smr.ma.cable.rcn.com) has joined channel ##math
[07:46.05] <Cale> dispersed: So, you believe there's an injection from the real numbers to the natural numbers?
[07:46.53] <dispersed> Cale: yeah.. but also that there is an infinite amount of ways to go wrong with the injection
[07:47.01] <dispersed> the point is you need to avoid counting to infinity
[07:47.04] <Cale> What does that mean?
[07:47.09] <Cale> That's silly :)
[07:47.10] * SmoMo (~smomo@host86-152-224-248.range86-152.btcentralplus.com) Quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[07:47.14] * SmoMo_ (~smomo@host86-152-224-248.range86-152.btcentralplus.com) has joined channel ##math
[07:47.40] <dispersed> that's not a good argument IMO
[07:48.00] <dispersed> if you start listing the pairs in the injection
[07:48.08] * thevishy (~thegladia@122.172.188.221) has joined channel ##math
[07:48.10] * thevishy (~thegladia@122.172.188.221) Quit (Max SendQ exceeded)
[07:48.16] <dispersed> and at any point you restrict yourself to a strip in the reals
[07:48.18] <Cale> Like, the diagonal argument is a *proof* that if you assume there is an injection R -> N, then you obtain a contradiction.
[07:48.29] * thevishy (~thegladia@122.172.188.221) has joined channel ##math
[07:48.38] <Cale> So there must not be such an injection.
[07:48.49] <dispersed> well it's a bijection obviously
[07:48.56] <Cale> Okay, bijection, sure.
[07:49.00] <Cale> Same thing
[07:49.18] <Cale> Assuming it's a bijection makes it even easier to get a contradiction.
[07:49.34] <dispersed> i think the construction is just wrong
[07:49.43] <dispersed> you need to forget about digits
[07:49.49] <dispersed> and think of numbers as objects
[07:49.51] * Jackneill (~Jackneill@unaffiliated/jackneill) has joined channel ##math
[07:50.10] <Ouroboros> i think the whole thing makes no sense because real numbers dont exist
[07:50.10] <dispersed> which do not have any particular properties that would be important
[07:50.41] <dispersed> because you can always rearrange the naturals
[07:50.49] * ystael (~ystael@209-6-53-93.c3-0.smr-ubr1.sbo-smr.ma.cable.rcn.com) Quit (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
[07:51.15] <Cale> Ouroboros: What do you mean by "don't exist"? You mean in ZFC there does not exist a set R such that R is a Dedekind complete ordered field?
[07:51.34] <Cale> Because I'm afraid you're just wrong if that's what you mean.
[07:51.36] <dispersed> now, if you have two such objects, ... two infinite lists, and both are randomly sampled from their sets (R, and N), .. you will never be able to complete either of those lists, except at infinity
[07:52.03] * tomnewmann (~tomnewman@user-5af46ff6.broadband.tesco.net) has joined channel ##math
[07:52.26] <Ouroboros> Cale: its okay, ZFC doesnt exist either
[07:53.05] * xacktm (xacktm@ip70-162-11-251.ph.ph.cox.net) Quit ()
[07:53.21] <Cale> Ouroboros: ...
[07:53.32] <Twey> Cale: I believe this is a joke.
[07:53.44] <sure> thats what happen when people thinks that there is only "one way" to exist
[07:53.46] <sure> existence is typed
[07:54.04] <Cale> Ouroboros: That's ridiculous, first order logic is easily describable, ZFC is just a first order logic with one relation symbol together with some axioms
[07:54.06] <dispersed> let's assume there is only one real, the one at infinity
[07:54.08] * balance (~balance@55.155.62.188.dynamic.wline.res.cust.swisscom.ch) Quit (Quit: Leaving)
[07:54.18] <dispersed> can you get there by taking x->inf in N? sure.
[07:54.19] <Cale> dispersed: You're making no sense whatsoever
[07:54.32] * superlinux-hp (~oracle@unaffiliated/superlinux) Quit (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[07:54.52] * atomicalloy (atomicallo@c-d6a571d5.123-3-64736c10.cust.bredbandsbolaget.se) Quit (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[07:55.15] <Cale> Ouroboros: I guess you can try to deny that ZFC exists, but that puts you in the same category as people who deny that cars exist.
[07:55.19] <dispersed> can't beat nonsense with sense :)
[07:55.23] <Ouroboros> Cale: i am just trolling
[07:55.32] <dispersed> I think we both agree
[07:55.50] <dispersed> I am natural, you are real, ... I am rational, you are irrational. Let's settle with that.
[07:56.22] <Cale> dispersed: There is no infinite real number. For any real number x you choose, there exists a natural number n such that x < n.
[07:56.51] <dispersed> that applies to naturals as well
[07:56.55] <Cale> indeed
[07:56.57] <Ouroboros> i just dont understand real numbers as a space, so by "dont exist" i mean "not useful to me"
[07:57.13] <Cale> This is called the Archimedean property of the real numbers, and it follows from the least upper bound property
[07:57.25] * brbblnch (55da1251@gateway/web/freenode/ip.85.218.18.81) has joined channel ##math
[07:57.40] * thevishy (~thegladia@122.172.188.221) Quit (Remote host closed the connection)
[07:57.41] <brbblnch> Hi
[07:58.05] <dispersed> Cale: Do you think the reals are a systematic way to give names to various numbers?
[07:58.17] <Cale> dispersed: "numbers" isn't a technical term
[07:58.23] <Cale> So, no?
[07:58.26] <dispersed> oh well
[07:58.30] <dispersed> I don't care about semantics, you know
[07:58.34] <Cale> The real numbers are a set with some operations defined on it.
[07:58.45] <Ouroboros> sure: how is it typed?
[07:59.15] <brbblnch> Is there a standard proof of the Church-Rosser theorem ?
[07:59.53] <dispersed> You can always create technical distinctions, ...
[07:59.54] <Ouroboros> brbblnch: probably the one in their paper?
[08:00.02] * fstd (~fstd@unaffiliated/fisted) Quit (Remote host closed the connection)
[08:00.11] <Cale> brbblnch: Which lambda calculus do you want that for?
[08:00.28] * SmoMo_ (~smomo@host86-152-224-248.range86-152.btcentralplus.com) Quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[08:00.35] <brbblnch> Hum, let's say untyped. Is it any different for a typed lambda calculus ?
[08:00.54] * fstd (~fstd@unaffiliated/fisted) has joined channel ##math
[08:00.55] * Betal (~Beta@unaffiliated/betal) has joined channel ##math
[08:00.55] <Cale> brbblnch: For typed lambda calculi, the proofs are often much simpler, because you can proceed by induction on the derivation for the type of the term.
[08:01.04] * SmoMo (~smomo@host86-152-224-248.range86-152.btcentralplus.com) has joined channel ##math
[08:01.23] <brbblnch> Cale: Then, I'd rather do the untyped one, and I guess it would still apply when typed
[08:01.52] <Cale> Well, assuming your typed lambda calculus has an untyped one underneath, yeah.
[08:02.21] <Cale> (once you start having terms depending on types and vice-versa, that starts getting interesting)
[08:02.26] <brbblnch> Cale: Not even to that point, but I guess the proof could be adapted
[08:02.27] <dispersed> Ok I will give one more example... let's say you inject to the naturals all the numbers divisible by 3. Let's assume you do the same for every prime. Notice how you have now counted to infinity an infinity of times. This is how you construct a "greater cardinality"
[08:02.28] * andersonc0d3 (~andersonc@unaffiliated/andersonc0d3) Quit (Ping timeout: 244 seconds)
[08:02.57] <dispersed> if reals are defined somehow algorithmically by counting to infinite an infinite amount of times, it is a problem with the algorithm, not the reals
[08:02.59] <Cale> dispersed: no
[08:03.13] <Cale> dispersed: A countable disjoint union of countable sets is still countable
[08:03.14] <wei2912> lol
[08:03.15] * yamadapc (~yamadapc@201.81.171.153) has joined channel ##math
[08:03.27] <Ouroboros> rekt
[08:03.45] <Cale> dispersed: To get a set of larger cardinality, you need to do more than that
[08:04.00] <dispersed> yeah, just to be sure ;)
[08:04.16] <Cale> The real numbers are not a countable union of countable sets
[08:04.34] <brbblnch> Also: when one says that u \beta-reduces to v, that formally means that there is a subterm u_i of u that beta reduces to v_i and then v = … vi_ … where the elipsis design the part that haven't changed, right ?
[08:06.08] <dispersed> Cale: Is a set of one real countable? sure
[08:06.14] <dispersed> now take the union of those
[08:06.22] <Cale> "a set"?
[08:06.29] <dispersed> yeah, like, .. {1}
[08:06.34] <Cale> sure
[08:06.42] <Cale> But you'll need uncountably many such sets
[08:06.47] * Kompton (~Kompton@unaffiliated/condenado) Quit (Remote host closed the connection)
[08:07.01] <Cale> So it won't be a countable union of countable sets.
[08:07.13] * Kn|t3 (~Kn|t3@106.51.243.136) has joined channel ##math
[08:07.35] <dispersed> counting corresponds to an order on taking the unions
[08:07.41] <dispersed> you take them one by one
[08:07.50] <Cale> no
[08:07.51] <dispersed> either you can take the union, or you cannot
[08:07.59] <Ouroboros> i am not really sure where you are going with this
[08:08.18] <dispersed> I mean if you start taking the unions, you are counting.... if at some point you cannot count anymore, you cannot form the set
[08:08.29] <dispersed> either you get your set, or you cannot count
[08:08.42] * red_horned_rihno (~red_horne@unaffiliated/red-horned-rihno/x-2983785) Quit (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[08:08.44] * CheckDavid (uid14990@gateway/web/irccloud.com/x-caaaqkfbmkidtuay) Quit (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
[08:08.51] <Cale> Union is an operation which is given to you by the ZFC axioms. You union a set (of sets) F to form a set U such that x is in U if and only if there exists y in F such that x is in y.
[08:08.57] <dispersed> are you saying there are sets of reals that are incompatible with respect to the union operation?
[08:09.04] <Cale> A countable union means taking the union of a countable set F.
[08:09.09] * pretodor (~pretodor@113.162.115.86) has joined channel ##math
[08:09.32] * ep0 (~whk.ep0@89.39.198.236) has joined channel ##math
[08:10.04] <Cale> and the "of countable sets" means that every element of F is itself a countable set.
[08:10.18] <Ouroboros> doesnt "countable" depend on the model or something?
[08:10.22] <Cale> no
[08:10.51] * austeritysucks (~AS@users69.kollegienet.dk) has joined channel ##math
[08:10.51] * austeritysucks (~AS@users69.kollegienet.dk) Quit (Changing host)
[08:10.51] * austeritysucks (~AS@unaffiliated/austeritysucks) has joined channel ##math
[08:10.59] <Ouroboros> someone was explaining this, like 6 months ago, but i forgot the argument
[08:11.26] <Cale> S is countable means there is an injection S -> N.
[08:11.46] <Cale> i.e. there is a function f: S -> N such that f x = f y implies x = y
[08:12.19] <Cale> I could have written that f(x) = f(y)
[08:12.31] <Cale> sometimes I forget other people don't all use space for function application :)
[08:12.57] <dispersed> forward polish
[08:12.59] <Ouroboros> right, but what is allowed to be functions can vary
[08:13.16] * enterprisedc (~enterpris@ip68-109-198-52.oc.oc.cox.net) Quit (Quit: enterprisedc)
[08:13.47] * PatrickRobotham (uid18270@gateway/web/irccloud.com/x-fhzouumuytlcvkyu) has joined channel ##math
[08:14.10] <Cale> Ouroboros: Well, okay, but I'm not talking about sets for which we can neither prove nor disprove that they are countable within ZFC. (I'm not talking about provability at all)
[08:14.12] <Apocalyptic> <Ouroboros> right, but what is allowed to be functions can vary // not it can't
[08:14.26] <Apocalyptic> a function is rigorously defined in set theory
[08:14.27] * Drashta (~Drashta@187-27-36-113.3g.claro.net.br) has joined channel ##math
[08:14.27] * Drashta (~Drashta@187-27-36-113.3g.claro.net.br) Quit (Changing host)
[08:14.27] * Drashta (~Drashta@unaffiliated/drashta) has joined channel ##math
[08:15.37] <Cale> Well, some models of ZFC might have "more sets" than others (both in terms of cardinality of the model and in terms of which predicates the elements of the model satisfy), but that's a huge sidetrack that has nothing to do with the statements I'm making.
[08:16.04] * FreeFull (~freefull@defocus/sausage-lover) Quit (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[08:16.16] <Cale> I think Ouroboros is confusing what we can do inside ZFC with statements made about models of ZFC.
[08:16.25] <Cale> There's a countable model of ZFC, after all.
[08:17.12] <Ouroboros> yes that
[08:17.14] <Cale> Where you have countably many things that your quantifiers are taken to range over, and some arbitrary "element of" relation defined between them.
[08:17.33] <Cale> But that "element of" relation can't be the real element of relation of ZFC.
[08:18.01] <dispersed> the trick is simply to be uniform with your choice of reals so you can keep the sets countable at all times
[08:18.09] * Kn|t3 (~Kn|t3@106.51.243.136) Quit (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[08:18.16] <dispersed> if you take "reals in the range between 0 and 1" or something similar, you lose
[08:18.30] <Apocalyptic> I suspect you're trolling dispersed
[08:18.33] <Ouroboros> Cale: can you elaborate a little on that
[08:18.39] <dispersed> because then you have just introduced a recursion
[08:18.43] <Ouroboros> [05:16] <Cale> I think Ouroboros is confusing what we can do inside ZFC with statements made about models of ZFC. | i am unclear on this

[08:19.07] * GreenJello_ (~GreenJell@184.101.183.147) Quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[08:19.08] <Cale> oh, sorry, I just realised that sentence is ambiguous
[08:19.21] <Cale> I think Ouroboros is confusing (what we can do inside ZFC) with (statements made about models of ZFC).
[08:19.28] <rudi93> "the set of reals is uncountable" is true in all models of ZFC
[08:19.33] <Cale> yes
[08:19.44] * GreenJello_ (~GreenJell@184.101.183.147) has joined channel ##math
[08:19.48] * Betal (~Beta@unaffiliated/betal) Quit (Disconnected by services)
[08:19.49] <Cale> Even in the countable models of ZFC :)
[08:19.53] <rudi93> yes :)
[08:20.13] <Ouroboros> that's it, i am getting by explosive vest
[08:20.37] * Nahra (~user@unaffiliated/nahra) has joined channel ##math
[08:20.54] * ammm (~chatzilla@85.64.247.83.dynamic.barak-online.net) Quit (Quit: ChatZilla 0.9.91.1 [Firefox 36.0/20150222232811])
[08:21.02] * Betal (~Beta@unaffiliated/betal) has joined channel ##math
[08:21.27] <sure> what does countable model mean
[08:21.31] <Cale> Ouroboros: You have to be really careful about which system your statements are in... the countability of the model is a theorem of the outer set theory you're using to study ZFC formally, while the uncountability of the reals there is a theorem of ZFC itself.
[08:21.44] <dispersed> ok, this is the last statement.. if you want to count, do not introduce an infinite recursion
[08:21.46] <rudi93> sure a model with countably many elements
[08:21.58] * kleister (5c4aec28@gateway/web/freenode/ip.92.74.236.40) Quit (Ping timeout: 246 seconds)
[08:22.12] <Ouroboros> Cale: i am not comfortable with having an "outer set theory"
[08:22.15] <dispersed> (except one that covers everything you want to count, obv)
[08:22.17] <Ouroboros> Cale: how would that even work
[08:22.24] <sure> rudi93: what is an element of a model ?
[08:22.30] <dispersed> I think this topic is a bit like do you believe in one god or many gods
[08:22.31] <sure> what's the definition of a model
[08:22.42] <dispersed> if I weren't an atheist, I would definitely be a monotheist
[08:22.46] <rudi93> sure well, a model consists of a set A and functions and relations on the set
[08:22.51] <Cale> sure: A model for ZFC is a set M together with a binary relation on M, i.e. a subset of M x M, such that the interpretations of the ZFC axioms are all true, where you take the quantifiers to range over M, and interpret the element-of relation as your chosen relation.
[08:22.58] <rudi93> sure and the model being countable means the set A is countable
[08:23.05] <Cale> sure: A countable model is one where the set M is countable.
[08:23.13] <sure> ok so its an internalization of ZFC axiom inside itself
[08:23.18] <sure> so there's nothing surprising
[08:23.18] * GreenJello_ (~GreenJell@184.101.183.147) Quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[08:23.21] <sure> take the empty set, it works
[08:23.22] <Cale> yeah, or inside another set theory
[08:23.34] * Rollabunna (~Rollabunn@109.255.58.201) Quit (Quit: Leaving...)
[08:23.35] <Cale> The empty set doesn't work
[08:23.36] <rudi93> the empty set is not a model of ZFC
[08:23.39] <sure> k
[08:23.41] <Cale> because of the axiom of infinity
[08:23.44] <sure> P(X) for some set X works ?
[08:23.56] * wlczkun (~e@c-98-235-165-166.hsd1.pa.comcast.net) has joined channel ##math
[08:23.56] <sure> hm alright
[08:23.56] * GreenJello (~GreenJell@unaffiliated/greenjello) has joined channel ##math
[08:24.01] <Ouroboros> Cale: so what you are saying is that there exists a model M that has a set called R such that the sentence S = "R is uncountable" is true, but R is countable from the view of the outer set theory?
[08:24.03] <sure> axiom of infinity fucks everything up
[08:24.10] <Cale> Ouroboros: yeah

[08:24.36] <rudi93> sure you can't write down a model for ZFC within ZFC (because of gödel)

[08:24.51] <Cale> Ouroboros: The entire universe of sets being discussed is countable
[08:24.52] <rudi93> sure but if you were given a model, you could construct a countable one using löwenheim-skolem

[08:25.40] <Cale> (in fact, for a countable model, there's no way it could)

[08:26.01] <rudi93> Ouroboros i have no idea what i did a year ago :D
[08:26.05] <sure> are countable models of ZFC complete ?
[08:26.09] <Ouroboros> yeah, me either, thats the problem
[08:26.10] <sure> i would bet that some are
[08:26.19] <Ouroboros> i keep having to relearn this shit every 6 months
[08:26.30] <Cale> Ouroboros: There are ways to construct a countable set M (i.e. your "sets" abstractly) together with a binary relation on M (which says when we shall consider x an element of y for elements x and y of M')
[08:26.34] <sure> hm no its impossible, it would mean that they are not modelsof ZFC
[08:26.37] <rudi93> sure i'm not sure what you mean by this
[08:26.42] <Cale> er, that M' should just be M, I mashed keys
[08:26.52] <sure> rudi93: in the sense of logic
[08:27.00] <sure> that is, you can write down all proposition relative to M
[08:27.04] <sure> and know their truth value
[08:27.05] <Cale> Ouroboros: such that when you interpret all the ZFC axioms in terms of this chosen relation, they all hold
[08:27.18] <Cale> Ouroboros: (and take the quantifiers to range over the set M)
[08:27.19] <rudi93> sure given a model, every proposition is either true or false
[08:27.30] <sure> rudi93: "and know their truth value"
[08:27.32] <sure> = proof
[08:27.49] <Ouroboros> Cale: are the x y just opaque there?
[08:28.00] <dispersed> Would it be possible to give a model on the countability of the elements of R, from M'?
[08:28.16] <Cale> Ouroboros: effectively. They might be sets, but the relation R(x,y) that you chose doesn't mean that x is really an element of y in the outer set theory or anything.
[08:28.16] <dispersed> Like, you could flag the countable elements of R as 'true' and the uncountable ones as 'false'?
[08:28.18] <sure> dispersed: nobody ever said that there is countably elements of this R
[08:28.25] <sure> it is even false to assume that 'm certain
[08:28.34] <sure> teh R you're looking at is not countable
[08:28.35] <dispersed> depending on how you tried to count (but failed because your model of counting sucks)
[08:28.44] <Ouroboros> Cale: so i am not clear why that is supposed to be paradoxical then
[08:28.52] <Rainb> Can a mere layman like me ever understand the proof for fermat's last theorem?

[08:29.18] <Ouroboros> can we get rid of it?
[08:29.27] <Cale> You usually imagine that there are a great many sets, but then you come to realise that you can only ever actually talk about countably many of them at a time.
[08:29.36] <sure> Ouroboros: thats because people doing logic in maths are stupids and internalize everything within ZFC
[08:29.42] <dispersed> -> you cannot talk about R
[08:29.43] <sure> thats why model theory is not good as a foundational theory
[08:29.46] <sure> model theory is math studying itself
[08:29.47] <Cale> Ouroboros: That's what models are all about

[08:31.00] <Cale> It'll never *really* be the "same" one

[08:31.19] <sure> yes, and this is what people do
[08:31.21] <sure> its meaningless
[08:31.26] <sure> waste of time nd paper

[08:32.21] <Ouroboros> Cale: but what about a set like 2^N? is it countable in some models but not others?
[08:32.24] <sure> i'm sure some retards are doing that
[08:32.26] <rudi93> there is inner model theory
[08:32.27] <Cale> You can get really cool results out of model theory
[08:32.50] <Cale> Things which are theorems in the outer system which would be otherwise hard to prove.
[08:32.54] <sure> at least its not "meta", so its better than going meta up to omega
[08:33.26] <Cale> The point isn't really just to say things about the inner ZFC you're studying, the point is to get hold of sets in the outer theory which have cleverly designed properties.
[08:33.29] --Filystyn-- logged in with account (Filystyn)
[08:33.32] <sure> but i don't think that one should trust a formal ZFC inside a semi-formal ZFC that is in any case not well founded
[08:33.37] <Ouroboros> Cale: what i mean is is the sentence "2^N is countable" independent of ZFC?

[08:34.38] <Cale> Ouroboros: You can prove 2^N is uncountable inside ZFC, and then every model will satisfy a corresponding statement, where you replace all the "element of"s with the appropriate relation

[08:42.07] <Arvinam> Any person who can help me with this simple math question? If you have a square and you expand the sides by 3 so that the area is 2.25 times bigger as the orignial square, what is the side length of the original square?

[08:42.39] <dispersed> So what is countability in terms of models?

[08:43.51] <Cale> So if it's the theory of groups, that means there are countably many group elements
[08:43.54] <dispersed> so countability exists in the innermost system already as something expressible in first-order logic, no?

[08:44.47] <Arvinam> sure , why is that?
[08:44.55] <Cale> We can talk about whether it's possible to prove inside the system a statement which says "x is uncountable"
[08:45.09] <sure> or maybe you mean "you add 3" not you multiply by 3 the sides ?
[08:45.17] <Cale> and even for countable models of set theory, you will find such sets
[08:45.25] <sure> if L is the side of the original square, your problem reads : 3L x 3L = 2.25 LxL
[08:45.26] <Arvinam> yes you add 3

[08:45.41] <sure> solve that :>
[08:45.45] <Arvinam> okay thanks

[08:47.28] <Cale> dispersed: So yeah, when you're looking at things this way, it's easy to confuse yourself. Another thing to point out is that there are really only countably many definitions of particular real numbers, i.e. statements which are satisfied by a unique real number
[08:47.53] <Cale> So that means that "most" real numbers in some sense are not individually definable.

[08:53.29] <dispersed> counting is not the problem, the problem is making statements about specific things
[08:53.36] <Cale> I'm not sure if I fully agree with you on the philosophical point there rudi93. I think there are interesting ordinary-mathematical (or at least set theoretical) properties which can be accessed via model theory, which are not really results about provability, but constructions of sets having certain desired properties.
[08:53.53] <Cale> Twey: no..
[08:54.07] <dispersed> or "lack of introspection"
[08:54.08] <Cale> Twey: What's the first real in the open interval (0,1)?
[08:54.13] <Ouroboros> Twey: that would be 0 :)
[08:54.19] <Twey> I'd hope
[08:54.19] <Cale> Twey: if x is any real in that interval, so is x/2
[08:54.27] <Cale> and x/2 < x
[08:54.29] <Twey> Cale: But x/2 = 0, so that's okay
[08:54.34] <Twey> Err, 0/2
[08:54.34] <Cale> what?
[08:54.41] <Cale> 0 isn't in that interval
[08:54.57] <Cale> Oh, you wanted the closed ended one
[08:55.01] <Cale> well sure
[08:55.01] <Twey> Oh, sorry.  I used the half-closed interval: ≥ 0
[08:55.30] <Cale> But then if you want the smallest element strictly greater than 0, you're out of luck.
[08:55.39] <Cale> There is no such element
[08:55.46] <sure> what i find crazy is that any "interval" of Q cannot be well ordered

[09:03.32] <dispersed> but I do think I now I understood what is meant by countability in terms of ZFC or whatever
[09:03.37] <Cale> In ZF + AD, there is an equivalence relation on R whose set of equivalence classes has greater cardinality than R in the sense that there is no injection from the set of equivalence classes to the reals (even though there is an obvious surjection in the other direction)

[09:06.57] <Nux_> what axioms in particular are you not using?
[09:07.10] <rudi93> dispersed you don't need any axioms. the definition works whenever the language of set theory is available. but if you insist: my axioms are ZFC
[09:07.23] <Ouroboros> Cale: i guess i dont understand they that set of recursive functions is uncountable
[09:07.41] <rudi93> dispersed (ok, you also need N)
[09:07.43] <Ouroboros> s/they/why
[09:08.12] <Cale> Ouroboros: well, wait, how are you defining the set of recursive functions?
[09:08.24] <Ouroboros> i dunno
[09:08.32] <Cale> Better figure that out first
[09:08.50] <Cale> If each one corresponds to a choice of Turing machine, then they are obviously countable.
[09:09.08] <rudi93> dispersed anyway, countability in ZFC has a precise definition and the existence of uncountable sets can be proved formally
[09:09.20] <dispersed> rudi93: I think the point is that how you define N is not enough to define (all of) R at once.
[09:09.51] <rudi93> dispersed you can also define N and R precisely

[09:11.12] <Ouroboros> Cale: wait, now i am confused if i am talking about total ones or all of them
[09:11.35] <rudi93> also, P(N) is a much easier example for an uncountable set
[09:11.50] <Ouroboros> Cale: or does the notation N -> N already imply that its total

[09:13.21] <Cale> dispersed: Let me take you through a little bit of development. In set theory, we typically define the set of natural numbers in such a way that 0 is the empty set, and then the successor of n is n union {n}, so that 1 is {0} and 2 is {0,1} and 3 is {0,1,2} and so on.
[09:13.56] <rudi93> dispersed N is the infinite set, whose existence is guaranteed by the axiom of infinity. P(N) is the set whose existence is guaranteed by the axiom of power sets. then cators theorem states that there is no injection N -> P(N) and it can be proved formally

[09:14.23] <rudi93> right
[09:14.30] <rudi93> of course :D
[09:14.40] <Cale> dispersed: Then the set of integers is obtained by taking the set of pairs of natural numbers, and putting an equivalence relation on them such that (a,b) ~ (c,d) whenever a + d = b + c, i.e. whenever "a - b = c - d", and taking an integer to be one of the equivalence classes of this relation.
[09:15.18] <dispersed> yeah, so over the position of zero, so to speak
[09:15.19] <Cale> dispersed: and then the set of rational numbers is obtained by taking pairs of integers and forming a similar sort of equivalence relation on them
[09:15.47] <dispersed> yeah, so it's again a symmetry
[09:16.15] <Ouroboros> Cale: ok, so lets take the set of total computable functions N^N where each element corresponds to a finite program
[09:16.55] <dispersed> same number corresponds to this symmetry equivalence (position of zero, or magnitude relation or whatever)
[09:17.01] <Cale> dispersed: once we have the rational numbers, we can construct the reals in a number of ways, but one way is to define a real number to be a subset of the rational numbers with the following properties:
[09:17.07] <Ouroboros> Cale: now assume we have a surjection N -> N^N, apply the usual diagonalization, is that new function still computable?

[09:23.39] <threenuc> 3+1/3 I mean
[09:23.40] <threenuc> huh?
[09:23.41] <Cale> dispersed: Yeah, you can sort of think of each real number as being represented by the set of all the rational numbers which would be less than it

[09:24.00] <Cale> (strictly less than it)
[09:24.11] <Cale> and there's never a greatest such rational number
[09:24.19] <Ouroboros> threenuc: e.g. x = 1 is a soluton of the left quadratic, you need to make sure its not also a solution of the right quadratic, which puts another constraint on m
[09:24.26] <dispersed> Cale: okay... I get that, I have never thought of them as sets of rationals

[09:26.41] <Cale> dispersed: I think it helps to have some idea in your head about what the real numbers actually *are* when considering these questions, rather than what they tell you in highschool which is often missing details.

[09:28.57] <dispersed> well, ... but if you just came up with all random digit sequences
[09:28.59] <Cale> dispersed: But with this least upper bound property, you can show that the set of real numbers {x : x^2 < 2} is bounded above (2 is larger than any element in that set) and nonempty (1 is in the set)
[09:29.04] <dispersed> then surely one of 'em would be arbitrarily close to sqrt 2
[09:29.09] * f03lipe (~f03lipe@189.122.208.96) has joined channel ##math
[09:29.11] <threenuc> Ouroboros, 1 and 3, but if x=1 then both quadratics would be 0 and there's no problem?
[09:29.18] <Cale> dispersed: and so that set must have an upper bound, which we can show has the desired property
[09:29.32] <Cale> dispersed: That's not obvious at all :)
[09:29.33] <threenuc> Ouroboros, oh, that would be 3 solutions, no?
[09:29.38] <Ouroboros> threenuc: exactly
[09:29.49] <dispersed> Cale: well ok, add to it that the digits may be in any base
[09:29.53] <Ouroboros> threenuc: and also its 1 and 4, but whatever

[09:30.23] <dispersed> any rational base
[09:30.26] <Ouroboros> threenuc: so the two left solutions are the two additional constraints on m
[09:31.00] <Cale> dispersed: It's the fact that maybe no matter which sequence of digits you give, perhaps when you square that number, you don't get exactly 2

[09:49.49] <Cale> Ouroboros: You can get essentially all the same results about countability in a setting where everything is computable, and the fact it's not surprising is approximately the same reason the existence of countable models of ZFC aren't surprising.

[09:53.33] <itsmeyo> oh wait, you can complete the square and you know that x=0 and 5 are both roots. So it's 25/4 >= f(x) >= 0 but
[09:53.43] <AimHere> itsmeyo, take the values at the endpoints and all the maxima and minima inside (using calculus), then the maxima and minima of THOSE values give you the range

[09:54.21] <intuix_> There's no need for calculus, just complete the square
[09:54.21] <itsmeyo> do you care to elaborate just for this example, so I know what you mean?
[09:54.55] <intuix_> completing the square is enough to find the extrema for a quadratic
[09:55.04] <Ouroboros> yeah, but its not as fun
[09:55.15] <intuix_> graphing would be more fun tbh
[09:55.18] <itsmeyo> what if I have x^6 + ax + b, I don't know what the graph looks like and I can't complete the square
[09:55.34] <intuix_> then calculus is useful
[09:55.38] <AimHere> That's when you do what I said
[09:55.38] <itsmeyo> and I don't have a graphic calculator and the exam is timed so graphic isn't a huge option
[09:55.43] <intuix_> whut
[09:55.45] <itsmeyo> AimHere: can you elaborate please?
[09:55.46] <intuix_> graph by hand
[09:55.51] <dispersed> does anyone here know about the theory of types?
[09:56.00] <itsmeyo> intuix: yeah but I need to save as much time as possible in exam conditions
[09:56.03] <Ouroboros> itsmeyo: compute the derivative, this gives you the min/max
[09:56.09] <itsmeyo> intuix: and a graph is long for an x^6
[09:56.11] <Cale> dispersed: SUre
[09:56.22] <dispersed> Cale: Do you see a connection between that one, and the countability?
[09:56.32] <intuix_> in the most general case aimhere's method is  best
[09:56.36] <dispersed> the rationals are sort of like "types" of real numbers
[09:56.43] <intuix_> but in your case there was no need for calculus
[09:56.55] <intuix_> it's like using calculus for the range of x^2

[09:57.19] <itsmeyo> Ok so let's say I have x^6 + 3x^2. The derivative is 6x^5 + 6x
[09:57.20] <AimHere> itsmeyo, well for the example, you have f= 0 when x =0 and f=0 when x = 5; Using calculus, you get f'=5-2x so f' = 0 when x=2.5. f(2.5)=6.25. Therefore the range is 0 to 6.25
[09:57.27] <dispersed> and, for each type, you have an exponential amount of different reals, in the number of digits
[09:57.36] <Ouroboros> intuix_: my favorite was when someone applied that method to find the maxima of sin(x)
[09:57.45] <Cale> dispersed: I can prove that there's an uncountable type in Coq :)
[09:58.05] <itsmeyo> AimHere: ok I see, just finding local max/min
[09:58.08] <itsmeyo> thanks
[09:58.10] <AimHere> Exactly
[09:58.13] <dispersed> Cale: Is type theory the same as theory of types? Sorry may sound like a stupid question
[09:58.25] <intuix_> which method were you referring to?
[09:58.37] <AimHere> Also the extremes of the domain
[09:58.38] <itsmeyo> How about determining whether a function is injective? f(a) = f(b) so a = b sufficient?

[09:59.37] * lnk (~lnk@mail.cerronavia.cl) has joined channel ##math
[09:59.40] <itsmeyo> ok so f(a) = f(b) so a=b  is good
[09:59.42] <intuix_> I guess it depends how precise you want to be with it Ouroboros
[09:59.45] <Ouroboros> for injective you want to show that its strictly monotonic

[10:00.07] <Ouroboros> intuix_: its just funny because it achieves nothing
[10:00.10] <Cale> dispersed: Also, the sort of type theory which is used to inform the type systems of programming languages like ML and Haskell
[10:00.27] <Ouroboros> intuix_: because if you know where cos(x) = 0, you also know where sin(x) has max, its exactly the same problem

[02:42.06] <stoopkid> _Fremen_: i think the answer is no
[02:42.33] <stoopkid> _Fremen_: nvm the answer is yes
[02:42.38] <b2coutts> _Fremen_: are you looking for a path or cycle?
[02:42.43] <stoopkid> _Fremen_: it has a hamiltonian path
[02:42.48] <stoopkid> _Fremen_: no cycle though
[02:42.56] <thegreatescape> so like find two numbers that multiply to give 504 and add to give -54. I'm just supposed to be able to do that? that's really hard
[02:42.57] <_Fremen_> b2coutts: both

[02:44.05] <_Fremen_> b2coutts: but I want to explain it with theorems and rules about it
[02:44.10] <b2coutts> for the cycle, you could take the same approach and attempt to construct a hamiltonian cycle in the graph
[02:44.27] <MotivicScones> however, not all trinomials are quadratic polynomials — for example, consider x^5 - x - 1, which is a trinomial with the property that none of its roots can be expressed using only rational numbers and n-th roots.
[02:44.56] <_Fremen_> b2coutts: and stoopkid: for example I didnt understand what it says here: "Given a graph G with n vertices, the closure cl(G) is uniquely constructed from G by repeatedly adding a new edge uv connecting a nonadjacent pair of vertices u and v with degree(v) + degree(u) ≥ n until no more pairs with this property can be found."
[02:44.57] <b2coutts> _Fremen_: meh, the definition of a hamiltonian path is a non-overlapping path that visits every vertex. constructing one is the most straightforward way to show a graph has one
[02:45.19] <thegreatescape> MotivicScones: i thinks that's what i was trying to do, right? find two numbers that multiple to give a*c and add to give b and then plug them into b. but i just had a hard time with 504 and -54.
[02:45.32] <MotivicScones> thegreatescape: so complete the square.
[02:45.47] <thegreatescape> MotivicScones: hold on, i need to google that
[02:46.16] <MotivicScones> you’re trying to factor quadratics and you haven’t heard of completing the square? huh.

[02:51.04] <_Fremen_> not just brute force it
[02:51.41] <justanotheruser> I have N poisson processes that cannot happen until the previous one finishes starting with the first one. What is its variance in terms of N and lambda? SD(x1+x2+x3...xN) = sqrt( var(x1) + var(x2) ...) right?

[04:49.08] <Bashar^> illustion, any common divisor would have to divide 1
[04:49.41] <illustion> yeh exactly bashar^ I was just thinking about it atm
[04:49.46] <illustion> if I do it by contradiction
[04:49.50] <bkboggy> Q is a set of all rational numbers, or quotients of integers....  would that mean that 4/3 is in that set and is a quotient of integer as well as a rational number?
[04:49.59] <illustion> suppose gcd(k,n) != 1 = d
[04:50.15] <illustion> then There d | k ^ d | n
[04:50.19] <bkboggy> trying to understand quotient of integers part and the difference from a rational number
[04:50.21] <bkboggy> is that same thing?
[04:51.04] <bkboggy> well... can't be, right... because sqrt(3)/3 is a rational, but not quotient of integers, but it's still part of the Q set
[04:51.05] <illustion> hence k = dq_1 ^ n = dq_2 —> kx + rn = dq1 * x + d * q2 * r = 1

[04:51.48] <Bashar^> bkboggy, sqrt(3)/3 is not rational. rationals are exactly the quotients of integers (denominator != 0 of course)
[04:52.00] <bkboggy> Bashar^, oh..
[04:52.50] <bkboggy> Bashar^, so it has to be a simple fraction
[04:52.57] <illustion> factor the d we get d(q1` + q2`) = 1 since by assumption d != 1 so q1 + q2 | 1 which is a contradiction
[04:53.02] <illustion> what do you think bashar^?
[04:53.08] <Ploppz> Just need a pointer in the right direction.. this should be simple: Implicitly defined function z(x, y): ＋＋http://a.pomf.se/njwciu.png，， I need to calculate ∂²z/(∂x∂y) in a given point. Trying to find the general equation for this second-partial derivative, I always land at 0...
[04:53.36] <bkboggy> Bashar^, alright, i got it... thanks a ton (found this definition: A rational number is a number that can be in the form p/q
[04:53.37] <bkboggy> where p and q are integers and q is not equal to zero.)
[04:53.41] <bkboggy> Bashar^, which is what you said
[04:54.26] <Ploppz> dz = -(∂F/∂x)/(∂F/∂z) dx - (∂F/∂y)/(∂F/∂z). Isn't this correct? Where F(x, y, z) is the expression at the left of the equals sign in the equation I just said

[04:54.53] <Bashar^> illustion, correct. however, you don't really need to assume d != 1. your proof shows that d is a divisor of 1, so 1 is the gcd

[04:56.19] <Ploppz> So that means that ∂z/∂x = -(∂F/∂x)/(∂F/∂z). Right? When I calculate that, I get an expression that only depends on z: -2/(5 - 4sin(2z)). Now, when I take the partial derivative of that with respsect to y, to obtain the final result, I of course do get 0. But that's wrong.

[05:24.21] <Ozera> I want to find c s.t. Z\3[x]/(x^2 - c) is a field. So that means I have to find c s.t. x^2-c is irreducible in Z/3[x]. We have three choices for c: 0,1,2. x^2 - 0 is irreducible in Z/3 becuase x^2 only have complex roots. x^2 - 1 has roots -1,1. Since 1 is in Z/3, it is reducible in Z/3. x^2-2 has irrational roots, hence it is irreducible in Z/3. Therefore, c = 1 allows Z\3[x]/(x^2-c) to be a field.
[05:24.24] <Ozera> Is that correct?

[05:33.33] <Ozera> Isn't that what it means to be reducible? If the polynomial has roots which are in the ring, then it is called reducible.
[05:33.50] <Bashar^> Ozera, so some polynomial has irrational roots over R, but multiplication in Z/n works differently, so there may be other roots

[09:18.30] <prasio> YYZ  (for example)  if you look at Max Tegmark's Modal Realism.  The first premise he sets out is that the universe is not composed of "substances"   but is actually composed of "math".
[09:18.39] <YYZ> since reality is thus "self-contained/describing", the very motions, order & structure of physical things, and the math and language which models them is "explained" as self-containment/description, the only source for such a "universal" and distributed syntax
[09:18.39] <prasio> It's like

[09:32.55] <math722> Hey im a 9th Grade Algebra I student, sorry if I'm stupid.
[09:33.19] <YYZ> math722 I know nothing about math obv :P
[09:33.22] <math722> Just trying to get behind homework at 8:30 pm
[09:33.30] <prasio> math722
[09:33.33] <math722> done
[09:33.38] <prasio>  x^5 + x^5 = 2 * x^5
[09:34.03] <math722> It's x^10 right?
[09:34.07] <centrinia> No. :|
[09:34.19] <math722> oh sorry didn't see you say that, I had to scroll down
[09:34.22] <hoodwink> x^5 = x*x*x*x*x
[09:34.38] <YYZ> that's what I said
[09:34.52] * FreezingCold (~FreezingC@135.0.41.14) has joined channel ##math
[09:34.55] <math722> So why is it 2x^5, so I can understand why
[09:35.11] <centrinia> If you have x=10, then x^5 = 100000. x^5 + x^5 = 200000
[09:35.17] <hoodwink> x^5+x^5 = x*x*x*x*x + x*x*x*x*x
[09:35.26] <centrinia> x^10 = 10000000000
[09:35.31] <math722> x = 1x, so 1x+1x = 2x and ^5+^5 = ^5?
[09:35.36] <YYZ> I don't think it matters if it's 2x or 999q does it ?
[09:36.05] <MotivicScones> math722: “^5+^5 = ^5” doesn’t make any sense.
[09:36.19] <MotivicScones> it’s like writing 1 + 2 = 3 +.
[09:36.25] <math722> I am saying the power of 5
[09:36.27] <hoodwink> when you have two of something, anything, you can just multiply by 2. ex: 1+1 = 2*1 = 2

[10:14.16] <illustion> I am trying to prove the following that Z[sqrt(-3)] isn’t a UFD
[10:14.30] <illustion> I already proved that the only units are 1 and -1
[10:14.40] <illustion> and 4 = 1 * 2 * 2
[10:14.57] <illustion> and 4 = 1 * (1 + sqrt(-3))(1 - sqrt(-3))
[10:15.22] <illustion> so now all is left  is to prove that 2 isn’t associates of 1 + sqrt(-3) and 1 - sqrt(-3)
[10:15.26] <illustion> but it is obvious
[10:15.31] <django_> BillyZane you the man thank
[10:15.33] <hodgeclass> ok so you're trying to show that 2 and 1 + sqrt(-3) are not associates in the ring Z[sqrt(-3)]
[10:15.34] <django_> thank you
[10:15.36] <hodgeclass> you said in Z, earlier.

[10:21.02] <lone_wing> If you know the radius, then if you can draw a line through the point of length d, and the point is r from either side, then yes. That is the center
[10:21.04] <Freshrr> Just trying to make sure of this.

[10:22.00] <lone_wing> similarly, if you can express the distance from the point to the boundary as a constant, then it is the center.

[10:23.50] <Freshrr> I was gonna ask you a question!!
[10:23.50] <hodgeclass> freshrr: or you can pick any three distinct points on the circle.  if the three distances to your point are the same, then your point is the center
[10:23.52] <calmdown> but u can ask me
[10:24.06] <calmdown> thats the best way to do it

[10:25.45] <Irrelium> Freshrr: for a practical way to do it, if you had a circle say on a piece of paper, and you knew the radius, you could set a compass to the length of the radias, and draw arcs through the circle putting the point of the compass on two different points on the circle

[10:27.33] <Freshrr> Lemme illustrate what I mean in paint.
[10:27.45] <Irrelium> If you know the radius and have some way of measuring things then you will be able to find the center of a circle

[10:36.15] <mocl4> You will need to use some context clues about how the problem is set up and make a judgment call. If the point looks to be near where you would expect the center of the circle to be then the point is likely the center of the circle. If the point is labeled O or perhaps C or is given explicitly in the problem definition as the center of the circle then the point is likely the center of the circle.

[11:28.00] <Freshrr> What...
[11:28.24] <calmdown> Freshrr u might have the option to take both calc 1 and 2 in the same year

[11:32.42] <SL0P3> A mathematician tried to fight me today
[11:33.13] <SL0P3> is that a common math problem?
[11:33.26] <Ozera> hodgeclass, do you know how to find the primitive and 4th roots of unity of Z/13? I'm looking in my notes and can't find relevant material
[11:33.39] <SL0P3> AOPS is like math for competitions... I'd tryin OCW stuff for "true" math.
[11:33.40] <hodgeclass> sure
[11:33.57] <hodgeclass> find an element with a^6 != 1 (mod 13)
[11:34.01] <hodgeclass> that's your primitive root.
[11:34.11] <SL0P3> kill me.
[11:34.30] <Freshrr> I also want to compete in math competitions, in 11th grade.
[11:34.33] <hodgeclass> once you find this, then 4th roots of unity are just generated by a^3
[11:34.38] <hodgeclass> so 1, a^3, a^6, a^9
[11:34.44] <Ozera> Freshrr, you are a bit late for high school math competitions.
[11:34.46] <hodgeclass> 4 of them

[11:35.51] <Ozera> hodgeclass, oh.
[11:35.58] <hodgeclass> there's an easier way in this case, since you can easily factor x^6 - 1 = (x - 1)(x + 1)(x^2 + x + 1)(x^2 - x + 1)
[11:36.14] <Freshrr> well these are the comps I'm talking about: ＋＋http://www.maa.org/math-competitions/amc-1012，，
[11:36.21] <Aniball> in my experience, you don't need a ton of knowledge for that
[11:36.24] <hodgeclass> so a = 2 is a primitive root
[11:36.27] <hodgeclass> too easy to find here
[11:36.31] <Aniball> maybe there are tricks you can pick up

[11:49.42] <SL0P3> Not sure if you know what youtube is... but it has some really great stuff, or so I've heard.
[11:49.49] <SpurSearcher> I feel very unlearned in math
[11:50.24] <SpurSearcher> it hurts my booyah
[11:50.52] <Freshrr> Don't worry I will definitely learn this stuff. Ozera, where is combinatorics on AoPS?
[11:51.06] <SpurSearcher> combinatorics? wtf?

[11:51.10] <SpurSearcher> I don't even know calculus
[11:51.23] <SpurSearcher> I'm expecting you guys to teach it to me
[11:51.23] <SL0P3> I cant even read.
[11:51.33] <Freshrr> Are you making fun of me, :(/

[11:56.21] <calmdown> hey hodgeclass i went ahead and tested the problem in python ＋＋https://ideone.com/w32eGF，，
[11:56.30] <calmdown> it still makes no sense to me
[11:56.55] <calmdown> 10000 tries and that equation isnt true
[11:56.55] <Freshrr> So LaTeX is just academic denotation?
[11:57.39] <SL0P3> ....
[11:57.43] <SL0P3> FRESHRR
[11:57.44] <Irrelium> LaTeX is just sort of a formatting language, you put special characters and commands in your file to tell it how to format it
[11:57.48] <SL0P3> ^
[11:57.57] * Arsonide (~Arsonide@doc-72-47-52-211.cabot.ar.cebridge.net) Quit (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
[11:58.04] <SL0P3> LaTeX is for formatting math. Easily do things like special symbols.
[11:58.08] <Irrelium> People use it for math because it is a way to put math symbols in a document easily on a computer
[11:58.41] <Freshrr> Okay, that makes relative sense.
[11:58.44] <SL0P3> Here's a "cheat sheet" for it with examples ＋＋http://www.stdout.org/~winston/latex/latexsheet.pdf，，
[11:59.26] <Freshrr> is LaTeX really that common.
[11:59.31] <Freshrr> ?*
[11:59.38] <SL0P3> Yes.

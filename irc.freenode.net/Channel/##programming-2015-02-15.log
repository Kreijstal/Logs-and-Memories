[09:51.12] <Myrl> pyon: I decided to buy a fountain pen.
[09:51.33] <pyon> Myrl: Already bought it, or just made the decision?
[09:51.43] <Rounin> int out = 0; for(int i=8; i<=32; i+= 8) { out = out | ( ( in & 0xFF) << (32-i)); in = in >> 8; }
[09:52.17] <Rounin> I wonder if that would work... It takes the last byte of in and puts in the first byte of out... Then it takes the last but one byte of in and puts it in... in what
[09:52.25] <Rounin> Second byte of out I think
[09:52.42] <Rounin> I'd be willing to bet a Zimbabwe dollar that it would work, if I had to
[09:53.11] <Myrl> pyon: Already bough tit.
[09:53.16] <Myrl> bought it*
[09:53.21] <pyon> Myrl: kewl
[09:53.23] <pyon> Myrl: How much did it cost?
[09:53.38] <Rounin> The bough tit... Most tree-loving bird in England
[09:54.03] <Myrl> pyon: $5.
[09:54.13] <pyon> Myrl: Ah!

[09:55.40] <pyon> Myrl: What will you be using it for? More precisely, what use case do you have, that requires a fountain pen? [As in, a cheap will not do.]
[09:55.41] * delusionallogic (~delusiona@0xd461eb60.inet.dsl.telianet.dk) has joined channel ##programming
[09:56.38] <Myrl> pyon: I don't like ballpens. That's the only reason I bought it. :P

[09:57.53] <wei2912> he hates friction
[09:58.00] <Myrl> wei2912: yep.
[09:58.07] <wei2912> which is why you need to get a better ballpoint pen
[09:58.52] * Poky (~Poky@ip-89-177-42-145.net.upcbroadband.cz) has joined channel ##programming
[09:59.11] <Rounin> Well, you have those other ones, which are mass-produced, but the ink just flows through a felt tip or a little tiny pipe or something
[09:59.25] <Rounin> I quite like those... Except I'm left-handed, so I get ink all over my hand
[09:59.36] <Rounin> But then again, I use a keyboard, so that doesn't happen after all
[09:59.48] <Myrl> pyon: Another reason is that it looks pretty cool.

[10:01.00] <pyon> Myrl: That's undeniable.
[10:01.25] <pyon> Rounin: "left-handed" --> So write from right to left.
[10:01.32] <Myrl> pyon: Lol.
[10:01.47] <Myrl> pyon: I heard that left-handed people are better at writing mirrored!
[10:01.56] <Myrl> It was from a murder movie, but I still think it's true.
[10:01.58] <Myrl> I hope it's true.
[10:02.35] <pyon> Myrl: :-O

[10:14.01] <Myrl> but my penmanship improved when I use a fountain pen.

[10:16.34] <Myrl> I don't know if it's low quality paper or the nib which disallows me to make visibly varying lines though.
[10:17.41] * pyon never used a fountain pen, can't tell.

[10:20.35] <Myrl> pyon: My biggest reason for buying a fountain pen is simply it looks cool. :P
[10:21.06] <Myrl> Anyways, about the improvement.
[10:21.20] <Myrl> I guess it's because I didn't really like thick lines.
[10:22.24] * LogicalDash (~quassel@104.167.105.241) Quit (Client Quit)
[10:22.25] <Myrl> Mostly because most ballpens that I used with thick lines either look dull, or they ink goes everywhere.
[10:22.52] <pyon> Can you draw think lines with a fountain pen? :-O
[10:22.57] * pyon asks out of genuine ignorance.
[10:23.29] <Myrl> pyon: Yeah. There's 2 sides of the nib.
[10:23.42] <Myrl> pyon: The front side seems to draw thin, non-varying lines.
[10:24.18] <Myrl> Applying pressure on the back side seems to increase the gap between the tips and I'm guessing allows for lines to vary.
[10:24.21] * cousteau (~cousteau@80.174.59.26.dyn.user.ono.com) has joined channel ##programming
[10:24.36] <Myrl> But on default, the back side draws thicker than the front side, at least for my pen.
[10:25.02] <pyon> :-O

[10:27.17] <_abc_> Hello. I am looking for a source code highlighter which outputs html but without headers. I can hack that function into higlight from sourceforge, but I would like to not reinvent the wheel. Rephrased: some sort of script or compiled code which highlights source snippets inside pages (usually wiki like and not only), and outputs html but without the html/head/body etc, preferrably as a span. Possibly with its own .css imported from a .css file, ...
[10:27.24] <_abc_> ... as highlight does it.
[10:27.38] <_abc_> Does anyone know of such a thing? I imagine most blogs and wikis have suitable plugins for this.
[10:28.05] <_abc_> Language is not relevant, should run on linux
[10:29.02] <_abc_> ＋＋http://sourceforge.net/projects/highlighting/，， I guess I found it... hm.

[10:30.18] * Big_G (~Big_G@c-98-225-5-170.hsd1.wa.comcast.net) has joined channel ##programming
[10:30.22] <rindolf> _abc_: and there's Vim.
[10:30.31] <_abc_> a2ps generates ps
[10:30.45] <rindolf> _abc_: see ＋＋https://metacpan.org/release/Text-VimColor，，
[10:30.53] <rindolf> _abc_: it can also generate HTML I think.
[10:31.22] <_abc_> It can. I use vim. I would prefer something not tied to a monster (vim). I use vim, emacs sucks ;)
[10:31.40] <_abc_> Anyway, ＋＋https://www.gnu.org/software/src-highlite/，， is more or less what I want, it's MediaWiki output mode will be repurposed.
[10:31.44] <_abc_> Thanks.
[10:32.05] <rindolf> _abc_: you're welcome .

[10:34.06] <_abc_> It's not clear if src-highlight also pretty formats source, or if it leaves it as is.
[10:35.00] * pimlu (~pimlu@128.172.35.10) Quit (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[10:35.00] <_abc_> aargh src-highlight requires boost. I booted that from my system, it is too huge

[11:39.57] <pyon> amigojapan: C and C++'s type systems make it hard to implement smarter inference.
[11:40.14] <Twey> pyon: ‘More restricted notions of mapping in mind’ — isn't that irrelevant?  The a is opaque, so I see no reason not to use a function (wrapping whatever notion of mapping you like)

[11:42.15] <amigojapan> that seems unnessesary to me
[11:42.17] <pyon> amigojapan: You mean, like, being able to use a function above the place where it is first defined (or forward-declared)?
[11:42.46] <pyon> amigojapan: The lack of a module system is the main culprit here, me thinks.
[11:42.46] <amigojapan> pyon: you should be able to use it anywhere in the code, withought needing to tell the compiler that the function exists
[11:43.21] <Twey> amigojapan: The reason those are needed is twofold: 1) as a forward declaration, so that code that uses that function can be typechecked without encountering the function itself (necessary when e.g. writing mutually-recursive functions); and 2) to inform other translation units of the function's existence
[11:43.38] <pyon> amigojapan: Determining the existence of a function at runtime is a major no-no in C or C++. So you need a module system to limit the scope in which functions can be "forward-looked-up".
[11:43.47] <Twey> amigojapan: Since the compiled code doesn't contain enough information to reconstruct the function's type
[11:43.58] <amigojapan> pyon: I think analyzing all the project’s files should be nessesary process of the compilation, and place the code before the usage of the function….   then compile
[11:44.09] <amigojapan> ofcourse we would need a project file then

Haskell will: a) scan the whole file for types before beginning compilation, obviating 1), and b) produce separate compiled modules *and* interface specifications from the same file to allow 2) without requiring the programmer to write the header explicitly

[11:46.41] <Twey> amigojapan: A compiled ELF binary doesn't contain function signatures, it merely lists locations where symbols can be found.  So it tells you where to jump to access the ‘foo’ function, but not that foo needs to be called with an int and a const char* and returns a const char*
[11:46.50] <pyon> amigojapan: Another problem is that projects are too coarse-grained an analysis unit, unless you split every single project into lots of very tiny subprojects.
[11:47.05] <Myrl> I most of the time have the metal part facing down, mostly because the lines it produces is not too narrow.

Haskell instead generates it from the source file.  There's no real reason C or C++ couldn't do that, but due to lack of module separation, compile times would be blown up significantly (and C++ is already infamous for having slow compiles)

The type information contained in the header is only used by the compiler to type-check the file (and indeed, using a function that hasn't been declared, e.g. printf without including stdio.h, is only a warning in gcc)

[12:30.18] <Twey> amigojapan: That is also an interrupt, yes.  Interrupts are (at the core) how you tell a CPU ‘stop doing whatever you're doing, and handle this thing instead’ (by jumping to some interrupt handler)
[12:30.35] * freepoutine is now known as poutine
[12:30.48] <Twey> pyon: Sure, but you can simply provide a function that performs such an operation — these are a subset of the actual functions.
[12:30.51] <amigojapan> Twey: so, an interrupt can be triggered by software as well as by hardware?
[12:30.52] <pyon> Twey: A benefit of this representation is that, if we apply a substitution "s1" to a lazy term "ref (s2 * t)", instead of forcing the lazy term, we can just compose the substitutions: "ref (compose (s1, s2) t)".

[12:36.02] <Twey> Yeah.
[12:36.13] <BlastHardcheese> A perfectly benign program could never need to do a syscall for anything either. When thinking about the PC platform remember that it was designed to be a single-tasking, single-user system running either PC-DOS or IBM BASIC.

[12:44.08] <pyon> amigojapan: What Feynman video?
[12:44.12] <pyon> amigojapan: Is it about computer programming?
[12:44.12] <amigojapan> mortdeus: then why are we limited to 4 or 7 cores? why not have 6000 cores? or more?
[12:44.13] <Myrl> What makes sure that the mutex value is the same ln all cores?
[12:44.27] <amigojapan> pyon: it is about computer hardware
[12:44.31] <pyon> Myrl: I think you ultimately need some operation that is guaranteed to be atomic.

[12:48.56] <mortdeus> amigojapan, the issue we face right now with 8+ cores is that modern day kernels (including linux) aren't really capable of scheduling processes across 8+ cores in a very efficient way. We end up in a situation where we start negating the pros of adding more cores because the computational costs of managing one plus core isn't linear its exponential.

[12:50.52] <BlastHardcheese> amigojapan: GPUs can have hundreds of decoders. It all depends on how complex the "core" in question is, leading to the questions of: what's the physical size of each core, how much power can you distribute across the chip, how much heat needs to be removed, can you keep the clocks in sync, can you route everything around on the chip...

[12:59.11] <pyon> apoip: What kind of job are you looking for?
[12:59.18] <BlastHardcheese> When talking about a general-purpose CPU, each "core" is just an independent CPU, minus the higher-level caches and I/O circuitry, which are shared by all the cores.
[12:59.26] <mortdeus> apoip, if you aren't in school to get a ph.d just so you can force people to call you dr. you are most likely wasting your time; unless you are truly incapable of learning this stuff on your own. (in which case, you are in for a big surprise when you find out that a degree only gives you about 1% of the knowledge you are going to have to be innovative and productive in technology)

I want a Ph.D because you only get one life and you might as well achieve every title of achievement you can reasonably acquire within the finite amount of time you get in life; however I wouldn't have been too happy right now if I had acquired a huge amount of debt just to pay my tuition at
[01:38.06] <mortdeus> Standford; also i'm pretty sure that if I had spent the last 4 years since I started learning how to code; studying how to code at a university; id probably wouldnt be 1/5th the engineer I am today.

[01:39.13] <Rounin> Yes, people have very different experiences here... I actually benefitted tremendously as a programmer from a university education
[01:39.28] <Rounin> It provided a good framework, you might say
[01:39.38] <DogPolice> It's definitely a good motivator.
[01:39.41] <amigojapan> mortdeus: I dropped out of highschool to study programming too…. I later just got a GED…a nd went on into collage….. I think it was a good desission,  but not so good in things like having a collage girfriends and stuff like that
[01:39.49] <sbrg> I have not learned anything in terms of programming skill since I started at my uni, but I have learned a lot about computer science, which is what I came there for.
[01:40.06] <GeneralVagueness> college got me into areas of coding I might not have messed with otherwise
[01:40.17] <Myrl> I normally say that college course degrees don't mean much. But how about for medicine and law?
[01:40.32] <DogPolice> Myrl: Both industries are more tightly knit to academia.
[01:40.51] <pyon> Myrl: Well, I guess the ongoing discussion is solely about the relevance of a college degree for a programmer.

[01:50.22] <mortdeus> however you can't represent somebody else in a court of law without first passing the bar exam and acquire a grant of license to practice law in the state you took the test in. Even if you go to college, you have to still pass the Bar exam. Most states actually require you go to a law school they officially recognize and accredit their degrees as a qualification of the education mandate enforced by the state's supreme court.

[02:02.41] <amigojapan> to be honest, I rather just let it go, than file a malpractice lawsuit most of the time….   it will just cost more money, and give me more of a hedache

[02:03.23] <amigojapan> pyon: yeah… ok
[02:03.30] <mortdeus> jrslepak, once you get close to your patent lawyer and they see you are a good founder and your startup is promising. You can pitch them the idea of letting them take you in as a part time apprentice and convince him that understanding patent law would help you protect his vested interest in the company and that you don't want to practice law (and essentially compete against him); rather you want to just be able to defend startups you have investe

[02:05.35] <pyon> amigojapan: I don't see how it's the fault of tobacco companies that idiots smoke themselves to death.
[02:05.38] <mortdeus> amigojapan, because the surgeon general warned them that cigarettes is known to cause lung cancer.
[02:05.53] <amigojapan> pyon: they provide the tool
[02:06.05] <mortdeus> also tobacco companies get sued all the time.
[02:06.25] <wafflejock> amigojapan, knife companies supply a tool that can be used to cause harm as well and in a more immediate way
[02:06.30] <pyon> amigojapan: Say someone uses a kitchen knife to murder someone else. Are we going to blame kitchen knife makers?
[02:06.37] <pyon> amigojapan: This is just ridiculous.
[02:06.48] <amigojapan> mortdeus: tobacco companies shoudl have become so unprofitable from law suits, that they are abandoned by now….. oviously the legal system deffends them
[02:06.48] <Myrl> i already appealed to ban card

[02:09.07] <rindolf> amigojapan: Opium?
[02:09.07] <pyon> amigojapan: Poppy seed got erradicated? IIRC, poppies are alive and kicking in Central Asia, especially Afghanistan.
[02:09.16] <Leftmost> Everyone is to blame and no one should be absolved.
[02:09.16] <amigojapan> yes rindolf
[02:09.21] <mortdeus> they don't typically lose when they get sued for people dying from smoking. However they might lose when it comes to making cigarettes more attractive to kids, who take up smoking and something bad happens. Like when the Camel Crush cigarettes came out with the little menthol packets.
[02:09.25] <JanC> cigarette companies also work(ed) on making cigarettes more addictive
[02:09.31] <amigojapan> pyon: Opium
[02:09.50] <mortdeus> its kinda silly, but people get mad if the tabacco companies act too "hip and trendy"
[02:10.02] <muttstuffle> (format t "Hello world!")
[02:10.05] <pyon> JanC: Ok, so we force tobacco companies to include in their ads warnings that excessive smoking can cause lung cancer and death.
[02:10.23] <muttstuffle> So we arguing about drugs?
[02:10.32] <BlastHardcheese> drugs are bad, mmm'kay
[02:10.45] <pyon> JanC: If people still smoke more than they should, they have nobody else to blame.

[04:30.55] <Industrial> Hi.
[04:31.04] <lf94> _W_: pretty sure, depending on the system you are attacking
[04:31.08] <_W_> lf94: let's say it took two hours to check each word in the dictionary, how long would it take to find a word in it?
[04:31.13] <lf94> some systems only allow you 3 logins then you are locked out
[04:31.25] <lf94> some allow you to login every 10 seconds
[04:31.41] <Industrial> I'm making a build system that compiles stuff (in 10 languages) from src/ to build/. The build system itself is written in a src/ dir and needs to be built to build/ How do I do that?

[04:32.15] <lf94> Industrial: make
[04:32.25] <lf94> pyon: that's what passmaze does
[04:32.32] <lf94> pyon: you can add unexpectedness
[04:32.47] <pyon> e.g., most people use actual words, and then possibly swap letters with digits or symbols, or other tricks.
[04:32.57] <pyon> s/e\.g\./i.e./
[04:33.01] <_W_> lf94: again, brute force is about choice of hashing. If you pick a hashing algorithm that is adjusted for the entropy of the passphrases and current level of computing power*, brute forcing goes away as a concern
[04:33.19] <_W_> *) and an algorithm that can have additional rounds added as computing power increases
[04:33.49] <_W_> pyon: less than people think
[04:33.57] <lf94> i'm not talking about bruteforcing against a list of stolen passwords
[04:34.04] <lf94> passmaze does just generate a hash
[04:34.05] <_W_> pyon: there are tools made specifically to model how humans think about these things, and they are frightfully good
[04:34.09] <lf94> there is no difference there
[04:34.12] <pyon> :-O

[07:24.52] <nisstyre> grill: this is sidetracking, but an NFA can be "confluent" right? (i.e. have possible infinite runs but still give the "same" result)
[07:24.54] <remline> redab, I view structs as a way of grouping memory together into a container. The exact alignment of the struct fields is typically unspecified.
[07:25.08] <nisstyre> like the lambda calculus
[07:25.25] <grill> nisstyre can be, or always will?
[07:25.30] <nisstyre> can be
[07:25.34] <grill> sure

[07:29.20] <nisstyre> what's the advantage of creating anything with malloc vs. automatic memory?
[07:29.30] <redab> yes
[07:29.38] <nisstyre> actually usually it doesn't matter because copying structs is fast
[07:29.47] <nisstyre> so I just use automatic memory
[07:29.51] <nisstyre> and you can return structs

[07:30.24] <redab> Well what about passing structs to functions
[07:30.30] <nisstyre> unles you're creating some kind of massive struct I guess
[07:30.34] <nisstyre> and you want it to stay around
[07:30.39] <nisstyre> redab: same deal
[07:30.51] <nisstyre> but obvs you'd pass a pointer to a struct if it was malloc'd

[07:30.56] <redab> yeah
[07:30.59] <remline> redab, I like to pass a constant pointer to the struct if it is read-only
[07:31.19] <redab> remline: When is a struct read-only?
[07:31.33] <nisstyre> config options or something maybe?
[07:31.44] <nisstyre> (although people use macros for that usually right?)
[07:32.28] <remline> redab, if procedure p() does not modify the data, then pass your struct as p( struct const * data )
[07:32.43] <remline> redab, that documents the fact that p() does not modify 'data'
[07:32.48] <nisstyre> what's the reasoning behind that?
[07:33.07] <redab> remline: Cool, that makes sense.
[07:33.18] <nisstyre> why not just let it be copied?

[07:33.21] * [1]Xardov is now known as Xardov
[07:33.50] <remline> nisstyre, it is faster to copy a 4-byte pointer than an n-byte struct (where n > 4)
[07:34.03] <nisstyre> but it's a micro optimization
[07:34.17] <nisstyre> I already addressed it above anyway
[07:34.22] <nisstyre> (pun intended)
[07:34.45] <remline> nisstyre, perhaps the optimization is small, but passing pointers is canonical C. It doesn't obfuscate anything.

[08:12.07] <muttstuffle> This one guy made a pseudo-supercomputer by daisy chaining a bunch of motherboards together, which was neat but also pointless
[08:12.09] <pyon> Wader8: I mean, figuring out how a loop works takes, like, 15 minutes tops.

[08:21.11] <_blizzy_> since I'm learning C# anyway.
[08:21.49] <bros> Super dumb question. How do you code while taking "spotty WiFi" into account?  I have a WebSocket-based web app where my boss is asking me to handle the WiFi dropping.
[08:22.01] <pyon> Wader8: We already know you aren't doing this out of negligence. You're doing this out of laziness. If you weren't lazy, you would've googled the syntax and semantics of loops in VBA.
[08:22.17] <pyon> Wader8: The change you need to make is minimal. Like, change one line and add 4-5 more.
[08:22.25] <_blizzy_> oh, I remember Wader8 now.
[08:22.50] <Wader8> okay pyon, you want to set up github site for the C# winforms ffmpeg config generator - fully fledged one, with no XML and direct Excel or Access fileformat support, or some other database program not from Office ?

[08:24.44] <Wader8> You talking to me ? oh okay didn't notice, well, what should I do then dogpolice people asking me more questions, blizzy wasn't here so he want to know the backstory now ... so what am I suppose to do

[08:43.06] <GeneralVagueness> yeah, formal mathematics and formal symbolic logic have standardized a lot of things over the last couple decades and centuries, and other disciplines have tended to borrow when they felt like it and make stuff up when they don't
[08:43.21] <DarkCthulhu> pyon: So, would proving the contrapositive be sufficient to establish the truth of the forward thing?
[08:43.36] <pyon> DarkCthulhu: trying to determine that formally

[11:04.22] <Snake2k> vdamewood: C == Love, very confusing, weird, rough love... but still love.......
[11:04.33] <nitrxgen_> horses have laid eggs under my skin
[11:04.41] <Snake2k> nitrxgen_: Champloo likes himself... nothing wrong there...
[11:04.43] * Snake2k hugs self.
[11:04.52] <vdamewood> nitrxgen_: There are two things wrong with that sentence.
[11:05.04] <nitrxgen_> i disagree
[11:05.05] <pyon> Snake2k: "Why?" Because, if I allowed "Snake2k.soul", your soul could be duplicated just because.
[11:05.12] <vdamewood> nitrxgen_: You think there are more?
[11:05.23] <pyon> Snake2k: Furthermore, the copy wouldn't necessarily belong to you.
[11:05.37] <nitrxgen_> vdamewood, im an entity of solution!
[11:05.37] <Darkcoins> shaunoo: Thank you! It now downloads the file! But the part where I enter the answer to if I want to download more files still crashes.. Champloo
[11:05.39] <Snake2k> pyon: So you're saying you would've made two souls of the same snake? >_>
[11:05.41] * vdamewood photocopies Snake2k's soul
[11:05.42] <nitrxgen_> we have no problems!
[11:05.51] <pyon> Snake2k: If pyon-lang worked like C, yes.
[11:05.52] <Snake2k> pyon: You, sir, have broken reality...

[11:06.22] <vdamewood> pyon: Too bad. I already duplicated it.
[11:06.30] <Snake2k> pyon: That's the nicest thing anyone has ever said to me :|
[11:06.43] <pyon> Snake2k: "(ref Snake2k).soul" is actually not your soul itself, just a pointer to it.

[11:13.19] <pyon> Snake2k: I want to rename "&" and "*" to "ref" and "deref", respectively. On the plus side, the new names are unambiguous: there is no confusion with bitwise AND or multiplication. On the minus side, they are more verbose. What do?
[11:13.19] <Snake2k> I forgot to eat food >_>
[11:13.29] <nitrxgen> forgetting is bad
[11:13.50] <Snake2k> pyon: Hmmmm that is true... Makes sense when you say it like that lol
[11:14.01] * Snake2k pop(ref pyon);
[11:14.38] <vdamewood> pyon: Don't forget the * in int *foo;
[11:14.49] <nitrxgen> i must retire for the night, da svidaniya
[11:14.50] <vdamewood> pyon: Might I suggest a 'pointer' keyword?
[11:14.59] <pyon> Snake2k: Oh, also, "pop" should not take a pointer. "pop" takes a stack and returns either (1) nothing, or (2) the topmost element of the old stack, together with a new stack.
[11:15.13] <pyon> vdamewood: Why would I need a "pointer" keyword?
[11:15.43] <vdamewood> pyon: Or have you eschewed variable declarations?
[11:15.52] <pyon> vdamewood: ofc not
[11:15.59] <pyon> vdamewood: But type inference!
[11:16.13] <pyon> val x = <pointer expression> -- inferred to be a pointer
[11:16.13] <vdamewood> var foo = deref bar; ?
[11:16.13] <Snake2k> nitrxgen: Peace!
[11:16.29] <vdamewood> err var foo = ref bar;
[11:16.45] <Snake2k> pyon: Yea pyon is a pointer to a stack, pop() manipulates that stack,
[11:17.01] <pyon> Snake2k: We don't manipulate mutable objects through pointers, that's evil.
[11:17.34] <DogPolice> pyon's right here. pop() returns a tuple of the value popped and the resultant stack.
[11:17.36] <Snake2k> pyon: Exactly :}
[11:17.41] <pyon> vdamewood: Let's say "bar" has type "T". Then "val foo : ref {bar} T = ref bar"
[11:17.53] <pyon> Or, "val foo = ref bar", and "ref {bar} T" gets auto-inferred.
[11:17.53] <pyon>  
[11:17.54] <DogPolice> Ya don't need pointers.
[11:18.02] <Snake2k> DogPolice: I'm being evil :'(
[11:18.22] <DogPolice> Not evil, just introducing an unneeded layer of indirection. :)
[11:18.23] <pyon> We *do* need pointers. But, like Rust, their use is controlled more tightly.
[11:18.41] <vdamewood> I love pointers.
[11:18.46] <Snake2k> DogPolice: Exactly :}

[11:44.22] <GeneralVagueness> thanks though
[11:44.30] <Barrin6> hash tables are great. take for a example in a situation where you had to store 5000 student’s student ids, where each id is 9 digits long
[11:44.36] <SEXMANIAC> hash tables are for faggots. get with the 5th dimension
[11:44.41] <grim001> well, I guess we know why he doesn't know much about hashtables. not enough interest.

[09:51.31] <lrs> And I substitue that to
[09:51.34] <lrs> 1/t^2+1
[09:51.42] <lrs> But the limit changes from 0 to inf to 1 to inf
[09:51.45] <lrs> I dont get it. Why

[09:54.18] <lrs> tsoulus, But how does it become 0 ?
[09:54.21] <Padawan-> lrs: exp(0) = 1. The domain you integrate on will change accordingly when you substitute.

[09:56.11] <tsoulus> Regardless of what you substitute with, you'll always gonna get "different" limits
[09:56.30] <tsoulus> Even if these "different" limits are the "same"
[09:57.26] * hrolf (~hrolf@unaffiliated/hrolf) has joined channel ##math
[09:58.25] <loostro> Hi... I have a problem with A = { z in Complex : | 4i - 3 | over |3i - z | >= 5
[09:58.50] <loostro> i've tried changeing these into polar form and dividing..
[09:58.57] <loostro> but i could not get it right
[09:59.01] <Padawan-> What *is* the problem?
[09:59.11] <loostro> i dont know "How" to approach this
[09:59.20] <loostro> im getting stuck with weird numbers
[09:59.22] * refs (~refs@dslb-094-222-025-011.094.222.pools.vodafone-ip.de) has joined channel ##math
[09:59.31] <lrs> Padawan-, I get this to [arctan t] from 1 to inf
[09:59.34] <lrs> But the answer is pi/4
[09:59.46] <lrs> But I get it to arctan [inf] - arctan [1]
[09:59.47] <lrs> :S
[09:59.59] * MutSbeta (~user@95.73.5.86) has joined channel ##math
[10:00.38] <tsoulus> arctan inf = pi/2; arctan 1 = pi/4
[10:00.45] <tsoulus> pi/2-pi/4=pi/4
[10:00.45] <lrs> Gah.
[10:00.48] <lrs> Thanks
[10:00.54] <tsoulus> You got it right :)
[10:01.03] * raskol (~ilb@unaffiliated/raskol) Quit (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[10:01.08] <loostro> (note: a similar task will be given to me on my exam tomorrow... on the exam we're not allowed for calculators... so I could not figure out what is theta where cos theta = -3/5 and sin theta = 4/5 ..)
[10:01.19] <Irrelium> lrs: heh, I had that exact problem on my last calculus quiz
[10:01.34] <tsoulus> There are standard triangles getting all the values
[10:01.36] <loostro> (that is, when changeing 4i -3 into polar form)
[10:01.43] <tsoulus> It's extremely hard to forget :p
[10:02.12] * raskol (~ilb@unaffiliated/raskol) has joined channel ##math
[10:02.19] <tsoulus> Moreover, if you get stupid values that's not an exact value, just set like a=arctan(4324/45545) and continue with a
[10:02.23] <lrs> Irrelium, Im having it on my calculus quiz. 6 days left until doomsday. ;_;
[10:03.11] * Cirus (~Cirus@2601:9:80:101c:e841:672:584e:7ab) has joined channel ##math
[10:03.44] <loostro> my doomsday is tomorrow ._.
[10:03.45] <lrs> Heres another question
[10:03.49] <lrs> loostro, Good luck
[10:03.50] * tmager (~Thunderbi@resnet-130-64-128-218.medford.tufts.edu) has joined channel ##math
[10:03.56] <tsoulus> Just learn the 45-45-90 triangle and 30-60-90; that should be enough for anything.
[10:05.25] <tsoulus> And if your teacher tells you otherwise he's a moron; math isn't about remembering arithmetical values
[10:05.54] <lrs> I know that (e^x/(e^(2x)+1)) is convergent. Then how do I know (e^x/(e^(2x)+1))(2+sinx) is?  Do I only need to now that  (e^x/(e^(2x)+1))(2+sin x) is <= to e^x/(e^(2x)+1))*3
[10:05.59] <lrs> It says *3 for some reason, I dont know why
[10:06.33] <Irrelium> Well 2+sinx can never be bigger than 3
[10:06.35] <Padawan-> lrs: |2+sin(x)| is bounded by 3.
[10:06.41] <lrs> Why
[10:06.47] <Irrelium> sinx can be at max 1
[10:06.51] <tsoulus> sin can only be between -1 and 1
[10:06.51] <Padawan-> Because |sin(x)| <= 1.
[10:06.53] <lrs> Right
[10:06.54] <lrs> Ah ok
[10:07.00] * Mr0rris0 (~sd@208.88.251.170) has joined channel ##math
[10:07.02] * mrdata (~mrdata@unaffiliated/mrdata) Quit (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[10:07.06] <lrs> Ok, but why did you add a 3?
[10:07.10] * oriig (~oriig@5.53.176.8) Quit (Ping timeout: 244 seconds)
[10:07.16] <tsoulus> Because that's the largest it can become
[10:07.25] * Bantalon (~Bantalon@c83-251-39-36.bredband.comhem.se) has joined channel ##math
[10:07.27] <lrs> But can you add a 3 to it
[10:07.33] <lrs> And keep the convergence values?
[10:07.35] <lrs> Is that allowed?
[10:07.42] <tsoulus> Anything constant isn
[10:07.44] * magic_ninja (~sparkie@ip72-209-161-141.ks.ks.cox.net) Quit (Remote host closed the connection)
[10:07.45] <tsoulus> 't ever gonna change.
[10:07.46] * X-Scale (~gbabios@2001:0:c38c:c38c:0:e472:b2c9:442e) has joined channel ##math
[10:07.55] <Irrelium> Well you know the part with the e's is convergent
[10:08.02] * meoblast001 (~meoblast@dynamic-acs-24-112-206-77.zoominternet.net) has joined channel ##math
[10:08.04] <Irrelium> And all the sine can do is multiply it by a number between 1 and 3
[10:08.10] <Padawan-> lrs: The point is that your thing is bounded below by e^x/(e^(2x)+1) and above by 3 times that same quantity.
[10:08.24] <Padawan-> So when x tends toward +oo, everything goes to the same limit.
[10:08.35] <Irrelium> And multiplying something by 3 isn't going to send it to infinity
[10:08.57] <Padawan-> Then it's just that theorem... comparison, whatever.
[10:09.01] <tsoulus> Try to think of the largest/smallest number that a constant/function can become in your domain.
[10:09.02] <lrs> I see
[10:09.05] <Padawan-> (I just forgot the name.)
[10:09.13] <lrs> So the 3 is just to make it more clear
[10:09.16] <lrs> Kind of
[10:09.37] <lrs> Hm.
[10:09.45] <Irrelium> Yeah, it is just trying to get you to think about it in terms of the sine part will never be bigger than 3
[10:09.52] <Padawan-> No, the 3 is here to bound it.
[10:09.53] <Padawan-> Again.
[10:10.12] <lrs> Also, if I get a fixed number. Like pi/4 when I do an integral. That means it convergent right?=
[10:10.14] <lrs> If it isnt...?
[10:10.22] <Padawan-> When it's bounded it needs not to converge.
[10:10.33] <tsoulus> If it isn't you get something that doesn't make sense lrs :)
[10:10.42] <lrs> like what?
[10:10.46] <Padawan-> But if it's bounded in some "nice" ennough way (that is, if you *can* do that), then it converges.
[10:10.52] <tsoulus> 1/0
[10:11.03] <lrs> tsoulus, Anything else?
[10:11.18] <tsoulus> actually
[10:11.20] <Irrelium> lrs: yeah, if you can get a number like that it is convergent
[10:11.26] <tsoulus> more proper would be -inf,inf
[10:11.30] <lrs> Right
[10:11.32] <lrs> So i figured
[10:11.50] <loostro> I've created a mathbin for my problem ＋＋http://mathb.in/27566，，
[10:11.50] <tsoulus> But if you get like 0/0 or inf/inf and a few more stuff you can't draw any conclusions about the lim
[10:11.51] <lrs> So if it is undefined like 1/0 or goes to -inf and inf
[10:11.56] <lrs> It is not convergent
[10:12.12] <Irrelium> Yes
[10:12.23] <Irrelium> It is divergent
[10:12.27] <tsoulus> It's not convergent if you can't find a number that will "contain" the function in your whole domain
[10:12.28] * tsoutseki (~tsoutseki@213.249.12.22) Quit (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[10:12.39] <Padawan-> Yeah but cos(x) also diverges, even if it's bounded.
[10:12.47] <lrs> And what would happen to my theorem then?
[10:12.53] <Padawan-> You theorem?
[10:12.54] * eyvindandersen (~eyvind@80-71-135-9.u.parknet.dk) Quit (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[10:12.55] <lrs> If that thing was divergent

[10:13.32] * Zupoman is now known as gender
[10:13.41] <Padawan-> Okay. What's your question about that theorem? I don't get it.
[10:14.06] <lrs> 0 <= (e^x/(e^(2x)+1))(2+sin x) <=  e^x/(e^(2x)+1))*3
[10:14.14] <Padawan-> No.
[10:14.20] * gender is now known as Zupoman
[10:14.23] <Padawan-> Your lower bound is not a nice bound.
[10:14.32] * wagonboi (~wagonboi@pool-173-51-93-143.lsanca.fios.verizon.net) has joined channel ##math
[10:14.32] <Padawan-> I mean, what are you trying to do?
[10:14.39] <lrs> Show convergence
[10:14.55] <lrs> But I wonder what happens if that is not convergent
[10:14.58] <Padawan-> Convergence of what?
[10:15.11] <lrs> Of (e^x/(e^(2x)+1))(2+sin x)
[10:15.11] <tsoulus> If it's not convergent the value of your whatever is gonna become -inf or inf.
[10:15.13] <Padawan-> The integral of that?
[10:15.27] <Padawan-> Or are you talking about the convergence of the limit of that function as x goes toward +oo?
[10:15.50] <lrs> YEs
[10:15.53] <lrs> 0 to inf
[10:15.56] <lrs> the integral
[10:16.01] <Padawan-> Okay.

[10:16.06] * `Eddie (~dedword@95.142.88.209) has joined channel ##math
[10:16.25] <Padawan-> Then 3 times your original integral (without the sine) still converges, right?
[10:16.30] <tsoulus> If you want to show that something is convergent, simply reason and "lock" something in between two constants/functions.
[10:16.30] <lrs> Yes
[10:16.43] <lrs> Padawan-, But now assume (e^x/(e^(2x)+1)) is _divergent_
[10:16.43] <Padawan-> And it's an upper bound to that newer integral (with the sine).
[10:16.57] <Padawan-> lrs: Please, write integrals when you mean them.
[10:16.57] <lrs> Would you be able to prove that it is divergent that way or what?
[10:17.03] <lrs> Ok
[10:17.28] * HenriettaSalt_ (~Henrietta@eduroam-160-126.dyn.carleton.edu) has joined channel ##math
[10:17.40] <tsoulus> Divergent stuff you need to find something "smaller" that also diverges; Convergent stuff, you need to find something "Bigger" that also converges.

[10:18.06] <tsoulus> If you wanna show that something is divergent and convergent respectively.
[10:18.23] <lrs> So I just switch th <= signs?
[10:18.30] <Padawan-> lrs: No, bound it by below if you want to show it's strongly divergent.
[10:18.48] <lrs> How do you mean?
[10:18.52] <lrs> "Bound it by below"
[10:19.25] <Padawan-> A <= B. B is bounded by below by A.
[10:19.31] * _Atom_ (~jawat@172.56.9.172) has joined channel ##math
[10:20.16] <tsoulus> let's say you have f(x) and g(x); if g(x) is convergent and f(x)<=g(x) it means that f(x) is convergent also. If g(x) is divergent and f(x)>g(x) it means that f(x) is also divergent.

[10:22.04] <tsoulus> Get Disconnect and some adblocker :D
[10:22.08] <loostro> ok.. i've come so far to this:  5 >= sqrt ( a^2 + b^2 - 6b + 9 )    OR  5 >= | -a + (3-b) i |
[10:22.27] * kapil__ (uid36151@gateway/web/irccloud.com/x-udalzzbkkzbzzpnf) Quit (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
[10:22.46] <metallic> tsoutseki, you can navigate the Internet behind a proxy server

[10:25.05] * russo is now known as russoneto
[10:25.49] <metallic> a more reliable option would be a VPN, but a proxy is good enough if you're not sharing any sensitive information (like passwords and such)
[10:25.52] <Irrelium> Heh, tor seems sort of extreme to get rid of some ads :P
[10:26.06] <Irrelium> I would just install adblock or ignore them :P

[10:26.23] * govg (~govg@unaffiliated/govg) Quit (Quit: leaving)
[10:26.44] <Irrelium> You need to be really careful with free proxies though
[10:26.46] <metallic> Irrelium, the point here is, do you want to not see them, or do you want to avoid being targeted by those ads?
[10:26.57] <poppycock> do you guys think nonstandard analysis is worth learning?
[10:27.05] <loostro> can i raise both sides of inequation to the 2nd power?
[10:27.35] <loostro>  5 >= sqrt ( a^2 + b^2 - 6b + 9 )    is that good ---> 5^2 >= a^2 + b^2 - 6b + 9
[10:27.37] <loostro> ?
[10:28.07] <metallic> poppycock, non-standard analysis is a generalization of the standard one. if you already know standard analysis, non-standard one is more like a logic exercise

[10:30.37] <Padawan-> metallic: Tor is usually more reliable than a VPN. Really.
[10:31.28] <wapiflapi> depends on your definition of reliable I guess and on the vpn you're using.
[10:31.42] <tsoutseki> loostro, well, you can if both of the sides are positive
[10:32.05] <tsoutseki> if they are both negative, then the inequality get's from > to < for example
[10:32.14] <tsoutseki> or the opposite
[10:32.18] * c4pt (~c4pt@c-71-224-151-64.hsd1.nj.comcast.net) Quit (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[10:32.34] <Irrelium> Oh I didn't know that
[10:32.40] <loostro> in my case, left hand side is 5, so it is positive...
[10:32.45] <Irrelium> What if one is positive and one isn't?
[10:32.57] <loostro> and a square root must be positive too
[10:33.07] <metallic> loostro, put it this way, if you raise to the second power both members of the inequality, can you undo it?
[10:33.44] * ChromiumTrees (~Metacarpi@unaffiliated/metallictrees) has joined channel ##math
[10:33.47] <loostro> is could square them both.. but the square root has both positive and negative roots right?

[10:34.12] <rfk> More than one definition[edit]
[10:34.12] <rfk> In certain cases, there can be more than one definition of a type or a template. A program consisting of multiple header files and source files will typically have more than one definition of a type, but not more than one definition per translation unit.
[10:34.16] <rfk> If a program contains more than one definition of a type, then each definition must be equivalent.[3]

[10:39.44] <tsoutseki> Padawan-, i think that when you use tor, your traffic goes through other computers, and other computers' traffic can go through yours, and eventually your connection. when you are an end-point, you're the first computer to get the info requested out of a website, before it bounces around. your IP shows up. imagine what someone may request to view online.

[11:06.52] <jhpy1024> lrs: alright, so do you know why 1/(y(y-5)) = A/y + B/(y-5) for some A, B?
[11:07.26] <lrs> Yes
[11:08.08] <jhpy1024> lrs: okay, so multiplying each side of the equation by y(y-5) gives us: 1 = A(y-5) + By
[11:08.31] <lrs> Ok
[11:08.47] <jhpy1024> So if we let y=5, it gives us: 1 = 5B => B = 1/5. Got it so far?
[11:08.59] <lrs> Why y=5 ?
[11:09.21] <jhpy1024> If we let y=5, the coefficient of A which is (y-5) will become zero, leaving us with just B
[11:09.28] <lrs> Ok
[11:10.00] <jhpy1024> lrs: so we can do a similar thing to get A. Let y=0 => 1 = -5A => A = -1/5

[12:01.25] <antonfire> caveman: it's pretty common not to distinguish between "functions with one argument" and "functions with two arguments" anyway.
[12:01.33] <antonfire> In fact, that's what you're doing when you write f: AxA -> B.
[12:01.50] <antonfire> That's a function that takes one argument (an ordered pair of elements of A), and spits out an element of B.
[12:02.12] <caveman> is f:A -> B another function?
[12:02.27] <antonfire> functions with different domains are different.
[12:02.29] <caveman> isn't*
[12:02.31] * magic_ninja (~sparkie@ip72-209-161-141.ks.ks.cox.net) Quit (Remote host closed the connection)
[12:02.46] <antonfire> So unless AxA is the same thing as A, yes any function from AxA to B is different from any function from A to B.
[12:02.51] <caveman> so won't it be illegal syntax wise for me to say "f" and refer to either function form?
[12:03.05] <antonfire> :(
[12:03.11] <caveman> sorry
[12:03.12] <antonfire> You seem to be under the impression that AxA is not a set.
[12:03.14] <hedgehoginfog> antonfire, in my example it's simply a fortunate combination of the coefficients that makes them cancel out, right?
[12:03.24] <antonfire> In both cases, you have a function from something to B.
[12:03.26] <caveman> antonfire: AxA is a set, i agree. but it's a different set than A,
[12:03.35] <caveman> antonfire: i think my question isn't clear
[12:03.49] <antonfire> Whether that something happens to be A or the cartesian product of A with itself, or some other bullshit, you have a function from some set to B.
[12:04.03] <antonfire> So you could say, e.g. "consider some set S and a function f: S -> B"
[12:04.47] <antonfire> hedgehoginfog: You want to be careful when making judgements like that.
[12:05.05] <antonfire> Often you can do a computation and see that something is true, but there's a "deeper reason" that it's true.

[07:33.31] <MotivicScones> cads: like Z-module said, x -> |x|/x is continuous on R \ {0}.
[07:33.34] <math093> or
[07:34.06] <Z-module> well, not defined at 0 -- it's neither continuous nor discontinuous there
[07:34.06] <math093> It violates the intermediate value theorem because there is no c between -2 and 2 even though f(-2)<0<f(2)
[07:34.34] <math093> its not continuous at 0 becasue of the jump

[07:38.55] <MotivicScones> then it’s nonsensical to ask whether the function is continuous at zero — it’s like asking whether the function is continuous at Jabberwocky.
[07:39.17] <mortdeus> is there any good math symbol dictionary/tranlation program or something?
[07:39.24] <mortdeus> a*
[07:39.29] <cads> there are two senses of an object violating a theorem that you could apply here - in the first the object violates the theorem because it doesn't behave how the theorem would seem to predict it should - in this case the theorem would seem to imply f(a) = 0 should exist, but it doesn't so the theorem is "violated". But that answer is confused.
[07:39.29] <math093> okay, but can someone help me get the correct answer choice.

[07:39.52] <cads> The second sense you oculd use is that an object violates a theorem when it shows that the theorem is actually false.
[07:40.07] <MotivicScones> cads: …in which case it wasn’t a theorem to begin with.
[07:40.11] <cads> Which our f does not do, since it doesn't actually fulfill the conditions under which we can apply the theorem

[07:41.57] <cads> in that sense there is no function that violates the theorem, and f does not violate the theorem since it is not continuous on the appropriate closed interval.
[07:41.57] <math093> so what is the answer then?????????????  pick the answer choice, not an explanation please.

[07:44.27] <math093> First choice: It violates the intermediate value theorem because there is no c between -2 and 2 even though f(-2)<0<f(2).  Second Choice:  It does not violate the intermediate value theorem because the given function is not continuous at 0
[07:45.03] * osoba (~me@79.175.67.41) Quit (Remote host closed the connection)
[07:45.10] <docdoak> In mathematical analysis, the intermediate value theorem states that if a continuous function f with an interval [a, b] as its domain takes values f(a) and f(b) at each end of the interval, then it also takes any value between f(a) and f(b) at some point within the interval.
[07:45.36] <Z-module> Surely they intend  "does not violate, because the function is not continuous at 0", even though they haven't actually said what the function *is* at 0. But anything they say it is will still be discontinuous at 0.
[07:45.52] <math093> Question:  Let f(x)= lxl/x.  Then f(-2)=-1 and f(2)=1  Therefore f(-2)<0<f(2) but there is no value of c between -2 and 2 for which f(c)=0.  does this fact violate the intermediate value theorem?  Explain.
[07:45.56] <cads> both of those statements are kinda mushy, in my opinion, but the latter one is far more satisfying
[07:46.13] <cads> since, by virtue of being a theorem, there is _no_ function that would violate it
[07:46.43] <docdoak> I agree cads, but I think the implication is clear
[07:46.54] <Z-module> (well there might be if our axiom system were inconsistent, which it could actually be, but so far we don't think so)

[07:48.56] <math093> absolute value x
[07:49.00] <docdoak> If the question means
[07:49.03] <cads> it certainly violates the conditions under which the theorem can be applied (the precedent of the theorem). But not because it contradicts the conclusion of the theorem (the antecendent).
[07:49.05] <docdoak> as I suspect it does
[07:49.06] <MotivicScones> well, I guess it’s already pretty intuitive… but the topological phrasing is nicer.

[08:07.07] <cads> docdoak: the sad bit is that math093's previous problem provided a perfect counterexample of a function written as f(x)/g(x) where g(a) = 0 and there is no vertical asymptote, ie, f(x) = |x|, g(x) = x

[09:48.20] <lrs> and min 1 ?
[09:48.49] <MotivicScones> Barrin6: “has nested subsets” isn’t very precise, and it also might depend on how you’ve defined the natural numbers (which, if your foundations are a set theory where everything is a pure set, are themselves sets).

[10:07.45] <Irrelium> Hmm I don't think that is right
[10:07.52] <Irrelium> How did you get to that answer?
[10:08.43] <math673> P(x)=3x^2-6x+6   lim x---->6
[10:09.01] <math673> its a continuous function so I know thats probably wrong.
[10:09.06] <Irrelium> Ah I think you misunderstood a bit
[10:09.18] <Irrelium> You don't take the limit as the function goes to 6
[10:09.22] <nahob> the limit as x approaches 6 can be found with direct subtitution
[10:09.40] <Irrelium> You take the limit as the average rate of change between 6 and x of the function goes to 6

[10:30.22] <DanOpi> Okay. I'm trying to rewrite it right now
[10:30.38] <somiaj> DanOpi: if you want to state the goal of your proof you do that by either stating your theorem or stating what alternative (yet equivlant by some other proof) statement you want to prove.
[10:31.18] <somiaj> i.e. say Theorem: Statement, or To prove teh statement ..., or somethign along the lines to make it clear you are not saying 'let M = Sup(S)' at the start. (:
[10:31.40] <MotivicScones> it’s fine to comment on what you want to prove at the start of a proof — just make sure it’s clear that you’re explaining what you *will* prove, not asserting anything yet.

[10:39.17] <somiaj> Might make it clear you are showing two things 1) M is an upper bound, 2) M is the least upper bound. But over all I think it is fine, and people varry on how much detail they like. (:

[10:52.09] <DanOpi> What restriction are you speaking of?

[10:52.55] <frelleck> and the second one zero
[10:53.00] <somiaj> the x can depend on the M y ou choose, each M can give you a different x.

[11:11.45] <MotivicScones> t0astt: here’s a general tip for understanding induction proofs: actually go through a few steps of the induction proof by hand. For example, if your base case is S(1), show S(2) using S(1), then show S(3) using S(2), then show S(4) and S(3), and by that point you’ll probably get the idea.
[11:11.49] <t0astt> anon_math: I haven't been understanding it in class for different problems as well as this one, so I would say the induction technique in general.

[11:15.26] <anon_math> t0astt: it might be helpful to think of induction as a staircase, I want to prove S(2) = 2/(2+1) by assuming S(1), S(3) by assuming S(2), S(k+1) using S(k)
[11:15.54] <wagonboi> t0astt, ＋＋https://i.imgur.com/1hVXc03.jpg，，
[11:17.05] <wagonboi> they just substitute the terms with the induction hypothesis. I'm not sure if I have the terms 100% correct but I'm also doing similar problems myself at the moment, and that's how it was explained to me
[11:17.16] <t0astt> anon_math: Thanks, I'll try that out a few times without using the "k".
[11:17.23] <t0astt> wagonboi: Ok, lemme look at that real quick

[11:17.50] <MotivicScones> DanOpi: to prove a statement of the form “there exists x such that P(x) is true” (an existential statement), it suffices to find one x for which P(x) is true. However, to prove a statement of the form “for all x, P(x) is true” (a universal statement), you have to prove that P(x) is true for all possible values of x, not just for one particular x.

[11:18.07] <MotivicScones> so, are you looking at an existential statement or a universal statement?
[11:19.55] <DanOpi> Universal i think
[11:20.00] <DanOpi> But i thought of something else
[11:20.14] <DanOpi> I don't think it's complete but a good start.  One second.

[11:37.52] <pedro3005> MotivicScones, i think the point of the exercise is to get you to realize what happens when you change quantifiers around in a definition
[11:38.16] <MotivicScones> pedro3005: maybe. the terminology “pseudo-bounded above” is still ridiculous, though.
[11:38.21] <pedro3005> yeah
[11:39.11] <pedro3005> especially since it really means unbounded below
[11:40.06] <MotivicScones> it’d be like defining “quasi-regular polygon” to mean a smooth curve with no linear segments.
[11:39.21] * shikhin_ is now known as shikhin
[11:39.55] <MotivicScones> it took me a minute to even come up with terminology that bad.
[11:40.01] <pedro3005> i guess their point is that they're taking the definition of "bounded above" and shifting quantifiers. the concept you get has nothing to do with bounded above, but the definitions "look similar"
[11:40.34] <pedro3005> and this is of course stupid because math isn't about the semantics of definitions

[11:46.15] <drazak> the shotgun method for proving things seems like its pretty bad when it comes to actually understanding whatever the thing is
[11:46.25] <pedro3005> yeah
[11:46.41] <pedro3005> and it seems like most of these proofs things are teaching people how to prove things without understanding them
[11:46.54] <DanOpi> Hm okay
[11:47.28] <anon_math> rather than "Let x = M-1, replace x with M-1 in M >= x" just write "M >= M

[11:48.08] <drazak> what I am trying to say, I guess, is that the only time its ok to say "does this work" is if you really understand it but don't know how to formalize it or put it in words, which can be the case, but often isn't
[11:48.11] * astrofog (~astrofog@unaffiliated/astrofog) has joined channel ##math

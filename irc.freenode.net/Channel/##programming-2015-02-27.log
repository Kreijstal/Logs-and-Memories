[05:16.48] <txdv> i hope you get some money from those bastards
[05:17.11] <IamTrying> It cold be a BUG, because i was using there products since they started txdv
[05:17.42] <IamTrying> never mind, thanks. shocking experience with google products
[05:17.50] <txdv> Put something on the internet
[05:17.54] <txdv> be shocked that it is on the internet
[05:18.15] <Plastefuchs> IamTrying: check if there is a sharing option used, disable it. it should close the option to open up the files from the link.
[05:18.32] <Plastefuchs> txdv: well, if you set it to be not be able to be shared, i'd be shocked too (when it is about google, ms, etc)
[05:18.37] * pyon wonders if a future is possible in which users have more control over where their information ends up.
[05:18.48] <Plastefuchs> pyon: ahahaha
[05:18.50] <Plastefuchs> ha :(
[05:18.53] <txdv> a bit is a bit
[05:19.01] <txdv> if you copy it to another computer, you lost all control over it
[05:19.06] <pyon> Oh, sure.
[05:19.06] <myrl> Plastefuchs: That moment when you laugh at a joke, and you cry at reality.
[05:19.09] <txdv> unless you have direct control of that computer
[05:19.20] <pyon> txdv: The point is having more control over who you share your data with.
[05:19.22] <Plastefuchs> and even then you cannot be sure
[05:19.31] <pyon> txdv: Not having to trust Google / Facebook / whomever.
[05:19.36] <txdv> pyon: encrypt, give decryption keys only to certain parties
[05:19.44] <Plastefuchs> pyon: amg, that is diaspora !1!!!
[05:19.45] * cougarten (~q@46.115.182.253) has joined channel ##programming
[05:19.55] <Plastefuchs> txdv: how do you make sure certain parties don't share your stuff?
[05:20.01] <pyon> txdv: I mean, making the Internet less hostile, so that these prevention measures don't have to be taken.
[05:20.13] <Plastefuchs> txdv: this is how we got new image formats with `digital eraser` built in :V
[05:20.14] * Gluesticky (~IceChat9@unaffiliated/gluesticky) has joined channel ##programming
[05:20.26] <txdv> digital eraser?
[05:21.05] <txdv> there is no way that that thing is not circumventable
[05:21.10] <myrl> I haven't been seeing SeabassChan lately.
[05:21.21] * Belxjander (~Belxjande@sourcemage/Mage/Abh-Elementalist) Quit (Read error: No route to host)
[05:21.22] <pyon> myrl: You want to see him? :-P
[05:21.34] <Rainb> Can you do nested functions in math
[05:21.40] <myrl> pyon: For some reason, yes.
[05:21.45] <txdv> the nice part of the internet is that distribution has 0 cost
[05:21.52] <txdv> and that makes distribution uncontrollable
[05:22.20] * paulp_000 (~quassel@2.94.177.119) has joined channel ##programming
[05:22.22] <txdv> in order to distribute a physical document you have invest much more resources
[05:22.27] <Rainb> distribution has some cost at the electricity and cycles level
[05:22.31] * Belxjander (~Belxjande@sourcemage/Mage/Abh-Elementalist) has joined channel ##programming
[05:22.36] <txdv> if you take the cost away, controlling shit becomes more difficult
[05:22.51] <pyon> Rainb: "nested functions in math" --> It's done all the time.
[05:22.52] * smustafa (~mustafa@110.93.212.98) has joined channel ##programming
[05:22.58] <txdv> Rainb: Well, yeah, but much less than physically someone mailing a letter

[05:23.13] <pyon> Rainb: Programming languages have been really slow to keep up with these developments from the last couple of centuries.
[05:23.31] <Rainb> Rainb: wat
[05:23.33] <txdv> its neglectible
[05:23.41] <myrl> pyon: There are some people who I consider smug but would hate it if they're gone, an example of this is aoseki.
[05:23.42] <Rainb> I self-pinged
[05:23.55] <txdv> its a nice thing, because it creates something that comunism always strived for
[05:23.58] <pyon> myrl: Oh, well.
[05:24.01] <Rainb> pyon: b-but programming languages are from the last centuries wtf

[05:30.02] <ninjahatodi> Ok
[05:30.03] <ninjahatodi> See
[05:30.11] <ninjahatodi> The administration is worse
[05:30.13] <txdv> i contribute to libuv
[05:30.22] <ninjahatodi> Libuv sucks
[05:30.27] <ninjahatodi> Install gentoo
[05:30.39] <ninjahatodi> Txdv: install gentoo
[05:30.40] <myrl> Alreadu did, thanks.
[05:30.41] <ninjahatodi> Ok?
[05:30.49] <txdv> i'm into that entire async fetish
[05:30.51] <ninjahatodi> Now
[05:30.56] <txdv> but I don't think that most languages do it right
[05:30.57] <ams> txdv: cool
[05:31.03] <ninjahatodi> Use socket io
[05:31.09] <ninjahatodi> It os async
[05:31.12] * ninjahatodi (~androirc@117.201.165.253) Quit (Quit: Leaving)
[05:31.22] <txdv> except maybe erlang
[05:31.25] <myrl> txdv: Correction, async is never right.
[05:31.28] <ams> txdv: i used libuv in a common lisp project
[05:31.37] * Dylo (~Dylo@AOrleans-652-1-32-38.w90-19.abo.wanadoo.fr) has joined channel ##programming
[05:32.04] <Rainb> pyon: Now that I think of it, I just want to use the results of the function in wolframalpha, as it seems for me, it doesn't seem wrong
[05:32.06] <ams> i am not sure what to think about async really... erlang is nice in that regard, but i think the language as such is horrible
[05:32.19] * Dylo (~Dylo@AOrleans-652-1-32-38.w90-19.abo.wanadoo.fr) Quit (Excess Flood)

[05:33.09] * greensnow (5bd895b2@gateway/web/freenode/ip.91.216.149.178) Quit (Client Quit)
[05:33.10] <pyon> ams: It's sad that the language only groks concurrency, but not data parallelism.
[05:33.14] <txdv> myrl: I don't know, creating a thread and putting it into "BLOCKING" state just so you can control your state of the programm ... is a bit wasteful
[05:33.16] <ams> pyon: yeah
[05:33.52] * Iodt (~Iodt@89-159-36-45.rev.dartybox.com) Quit (Excess Flood)
[05:34.11] * Iazrq (~Iazrq@89-93-136-125.hfc.dyn.abo.bbox.fr) has joined channel ##programming
[05:34.13] <ams> anyway, time to hack some ..
[05:34.16] <myrl> txdv: Thing is, all async is done with polling in underlying hardware.
[05:34.16] <txdv> ams: was that project paid for or did you do it for fun?
[05:34.27] <myrl> Or software.
[05:34.39] <txdv> i dont think so
[05:34.45] <myrl> Interrupts for example, is not really async.
[05:34.50] * Iazrq (~Iazrq@89-93-136-125.hfc.dyn.abo.bbox.fr) Quit (Excess Flood)
[05:35.05] <myrl> Interrupts are checked on the falling edge.
[05:35.09] * xao (~xao@89-93-136-125.hfc.dyn.abo.bbox.fr) has joined channel ##programming
[05:35.21] <myrl> are* not really async.
[05:35.24] * qoio (~qoio@AStrasbourg-552-1-113-104.w86-204.abo.wanadoo.fr) Quit (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[05:35.32] <ams> txdv: paid for
[05:35.33] * xao is now known as Guest92960
[05:35.41] <myrl> And simply by that, one can conclude that no real async exists in software.
[05:35.59] <txdv> who pays for lisp?
[05:36.18] <ams> people who needs to get stuff done :-)
[05:36.20] <txdv> myrl: before you claim that you should probably define what you think async is
[05:36.21] <ams> and companies
[05:36.38] <myrl> txdv: Async mean no reliance on a clock.
[05:37.22] <txdv> since every operation on a cpu takes some time to compute, that definition is unrealistic for computers
[05:37.33] * rcris01 (~rcris01@50.127.45.173) has joined channel ##programming
[05:37.46] --Baronawesome-- logged in with account (Baronawesome)
[05:37.50] <myrl> txdv: Every operation, however, relies on the clock as an I/O.
[05:38.03] <txdv> wat
[05:38.04] <myrl> Sure, one may say that every pipeline stage is async.
[05:38.50] <myrl> txdv: You disagree that every operation relies on the clock as an I/O sync?
[05:39.15] * ninjahatodi (~androirc@117.201.165.253) has joined channel ##programming
[05:39.21] <pyon> myrl: I thought "async" meant "no reliance on synchronized completion".
[05:39.31] <ninjahatodi> Im back async fuckers

[05:42.23] <myrl> txdv: Ah, I get what you mean.

[05:42.34] * paulp_000 (~quassel@2.94.177.119) Quit (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[05:42.36] <txdv> ams: did you create those lisp libuv bindings?
[05:42.46] <txdv> what lisp runtime did you use?
[05:42.52] <txdv> did you open source the lisp bindings?
[05:43.02] <myrl> txdv: I guess in that context, it's true.
[05:43.24] <ams> txdv: i used cl-libuv, and use sbcl normally.
[05:43.59] <ams> txdv: cl-async was on the map, but decided against it since it tried to much imho

[05:46.39] <txdv> Look, this guy understand async completely
[05:46.50] <ams> you will need to ask them :-)
[05:46.56] <txdv> I won't
[05:46.59] <txdv> ill just add it to the wiki
[05:47.05] <ams> add cl-async too
[05:47.31] <txdv> its by the same guy
[05:47.34] * tus (~tus@unaffiliated/tus) has joined channel ##programming
[05:47.39] <txdv> are you sure that cl-async is not just an abstraction on top of cl-libuv?
[05:47.40] <ams> cl-libuv is just ffi over libuv, and cl-async is more sane functions over cl-libuv
[05:48.04] <txdv> but you decided against cl-async because it was too much?
[05:48.11] <ams> for what i needed yes
[05:49.07] <txdv> and what did you need?

[05:58.00] <txdv> the only proble with C# await/async is that they are too fat of an abstraction and introduce a substational amount of overhead for simple operations like "read something into a buffer"

Since we have to do it anyway, we'd really like to turn it into a nice CV side-project. Web apps/games are excluded. Good ideas up to this point were : Something similar to BOINC and a p2p cloud storage service (which seems to contradict itself). Any ideas?

[06:55.51] <Plastefuchs> as in, call a C function from within your $language code
[06:56.01] * ghostpl_ (~ghostpl@public-gprs515240.centertel.pl) has joined channel ##programming
[06:56.21] <pyon> Plastefuchs: That's the common thing. Less commonly, one should also be able to call $language code from C.
[06:56.42] <txdv> with ffi you can even call C++ code
[06:56.56] <txdv> the only problem is that different compilers produce different mangled names
[06:57.13] <pyon> rpr: "unfriendly" --> That I need to be aware that I'm calling C when writing Haskell. I don't want to have to free resources when writing Haskell.

[06:57.46] <imv> pyon, aren't pretty much all languages compatible from each other, though? I mean, if it's another compiled language, deal with it at link time, if it's, say, Java, have the JVM run the code and whatnot
[06:58.24] <pyon> imv: "compatible" --> In what sense?

[07:00.03] <imv> txdv, didn't think of that, but it makes sense why it sucks
[07:00.24] <imv> aawe, aaaaand that's why I need industry experience
[07:01.06] <txdv> java code generally doesn't run without a runtime
[07:01.12] <txdv> so you immediately need a runtime
[07:01.18] <pyon> Anyway, the JVM doesn't concern me. The only reason why I'd like to call code written in another language is runtime performance. Hence why calling C.
[07:01.30] <txdv> now imagine you are using C#, you already have a runtime! why would you want to run another runtime?!
[07:01.42] <txdv> then you have 2 runtimes and you need to serialize the objects between each other
[07:02.17] <txdv> luckily we have ikvm.net
[07:02.21] <pyon> How would this serialization be performed? Byte streams? Temporary files? (lol)
[07:02.32] <imv> txdv, why the heck does C# need a runtime, since it's a Microsoft pet peeve?
[07:03.00] <imv> txdv, never had to deal with C# before, but this feels weird
[07:03.04] <txdv> because it is not native code
[07:04.12] <pyon> imv: The .NET runtime provides basic services that pretty much every C# program relies upon, like handling type metadata (generics, downcasting, reflection), garbage collection, etc.

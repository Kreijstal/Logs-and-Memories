[08:12.17] <blablaa> vonStrauss, that's total misunderstanding
[08:12.24] <vonStrauss> well then make me understand
[08:12.47] <blablaa> first of all, "spend" doesn't mean what it means in english in that jargon
[08:12.52] <blablaa> it's not circulation of money or whatever
[08:12.59] <blablaa> it means GDP
[08:13.26] <blablaa> so, "savers" vs GDP
[08:13.55] <blablaa> second, what is meaning of "savers"? people that don't consume and hold something? hold what?
[08:14.35] <blablaa> and generally when people say "savers" are being hurt, they mean people with *money* and money-denominated bonds
[08:14.36] <vonStrauss> stash it in the bank?
[08:14.54] <blablaa> there is no "it" to stash in the bank, that's the problem
[08:14.56] <vonStrauss> AH
[08:14.59] <blablaa> the bank account is the IT
[08:15.00] <vonStrauss> Ah*
[08:15.03] <vonStrauss> I see
[08:15.22] <vonStrauss> So the whole dichotomy doesn't make sense, I getcha
[08:15.38] <vonStrauss> Now can anyone explain to me this stupid argument that "money is debt.
[08:15.54] <blablaa> so,it's a sort of "let's reward bank account holders and money holders and bond holder vs let's just push higher GDP via government spending"
[08:16.04] <vonStrauss> Yep, I gotcha
[08:16.08] <blablaa> it makes some sense, but it's just that people don't get what it means until it's translated into normal english.
[08:16.25] <vonStrauss> what about these people who say 'money isn't real, interest and debt are not real, are whole financial system has been set up to steal" you know these people
[08:16.44] <vonStrauss> like these zeitgeist people

[08:17.36] <vonStrauss> why do you associate with these crazy bastards
[08:17.59] <blablaa> vonStrauss, btw, on the "savers" issue, just take note of this... if gov is too much in favor of them and accepts strong deflation, then the entire house of paper wealth comes down and they lose too
[08:18.23] <blablaa> vonStrauss, so paradoxically, the "savers" are lobbying hard for the destruction of their paper wealth in many countires (example is Germany)
[08:18.42] <vonStrauss> but aren't the borrowers lobbying for the destruction of any proper saving apparatus
[08:18.49] <blablaa> they want high interest rates on their accounts, they want deflation
[08:18.59] <blablaa> they want everything when economy is shit
[08:19.00] <blablaa> :D
[08:19.16] <mondo_kims> i don't know if savers congregate and conspire and lobby...
[08:19.31] <blablaa> mondo_kims, well, but that's just to explain
[08:20.04] <blablaa> vonStrauss, well some borrowers... those who says we need uncontrolled inflation generally are in that camp.
[08:20.17] <blablaa> vonStrauss, like venezuela or argentina
[08:21.07] <blablaa> vonStrauss, the most "reasonable" thing is to keep inflation at the level expected when the debt has been issued. This is most "neutral" in a sane sense i think

[08:26.18] <blablaa> in the 30s
[08:26.21] <blablaa> even the gold miners
[08:26.22] <blablaa> went bankrupt
[08:26.23] <blablaa> :)
[08:26.26] <blablaa> interestingly.
[08:27.00] <blablaa> (they recovered after some years)
[08:28.33] <blablaa> vonStrauss, most "free market" thing that can be argued is this: people should be allowed to have bank accounts and bonds denominated in foreign or metallic or whatever currency or index
[08:28.46] <blablaa> but only if they really want it
[08:28.49] <blablaa> not "as default"
[08:29.49] <blablaa> because it's so damn risky
[08:32.57] <vonStrauss> banking should be the least risky thing to do though
[08:33.03] <vonStrauss> right?
[08:33.12] <blablaa> well that's the idea
[08:33.26] <blablaa> so the "risky" should be legally separated from the non risky
[08:33.36] <blablaa> this is agreed by many except the banking lobby
[08:35.05] <vonStrauss> what exactly? that banking should be in a sense mandatory?
[08:35.51] <blablaa> what to consider non risky?
[08:36.16] <blablaa> this is hard question, generally, gov money, gov bonds, are considered not risky... "reputable" corporate bonds...
[08:36.23] <blablaa> ideally short term
[08:36.23] <vonStrauss> Wait a minute
[08:36.33] <vonStrauss> what is agreed upon except by the banking lobby
[08:36.44] * happyowl (~a@unaffiliated/happyowl) has joined channel ##economics
[08:36.49] <blablaa> that the risky and non risky businesses should be separated
[08:37.08] <blablaa> so when you go to your bank you know at which kind of enterprise you're throwing your "money".
[08:38.07] <vonStrauss> <blablaa> that the risky and non risky businesses should be separated
[08:38.11] <vonStrauss> sorry, what does this mean exactly?
[08:38.21] <vonStrauss> like that the bank will lend out your money to non risky businesses?

[08:38.57] <blablaa> probably should be done again. it was done in 30s, has to be done again in 2010s...
[08:38.57] <vonStrauss> that's just a tax on stock sales right?
[08:39.24] <vonStrauss> republicans say that would destroy america's financial competitive-ness
[08:39.57] <blablaa> vonStrauss, yes, or if you want to be really strict, don't lend out (not lending out is equivalent to lending out to the central bank in case the bank account is denominated in central bank money)

[08:40.58] <blablaa> probably we should ignore that
[08:41.28] <vonStrauss> glass steagall would amount to restricting banks lending out to whom exactlY?
[08:41.41] <blablaa> yes, they say it would destroy everything, which is basically saying "people should just lend us their money as if we're sober people, and we should be able to play casin� with their money in legal way".

[08:42.46] <blablaa> i've told you, none except gov and central bank
[08:42.48] <blablaa> this is the most strict
[08:43.00] <vonStrauss> how will businesses get loans then?
[08:43.02] <blablaa> then maybe we can allow corporate bonds too of sufficiently monitored companies
[08:43.08] <blablaa> there is scome of disagreement

[08:44.00] <vonStrauss> wouldn't this damage an already weak recovery
[08:44.03] <vonStrauss> )for now)
[08:44.21] <blablaa> vonStrauss, determining this should be job of bank regulators not of irc chatters... if irc chatetrs have to do this, it's because bank regulators have done shit job :)
[08:45.15] <blablaa> you can phase-in this slowly
[08:45.26] <blablaa> just phase in eventually before even worse disaster
[08:46.11] <blablaa> vonStrauss, right now it's enough for US stock markets to decline to cause an havoc i think...

[08:46.19] <vonStrauss> believe me i haven't the slightest interest in implenting policies myself
[08:46.31] <vonStrauss> i do however have an interest in how the global economy functions
[08:47.06] <vonStrauss> i do not think it should be the preoccupation of regulators and central bankers to artificially induce market rallies by promoting unsustainable policies
[08:48.01] <blablaa> vonStrauss, sure, but the various QE are just to prevent deflation
[08:48.28] <blablaa> vonStrauss, i mean, causing artificial problems is as bad as causing artificial market rallies isn't it...

[09:34.23] <blablaa> i don't recommend anything

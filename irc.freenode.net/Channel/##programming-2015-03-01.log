[07:38.22] Channel Created on: 5:23 AM 2/4/2007
[07:38.33] <_W_> Deithrian: I suggest finding the jobs that sound promising first, then spending an evening reading up on exactly what they use
[07:38.43] <Beoran__> many public institutions have to pretend that they let the market play
[07:39.10] <_W_> Deithrian: if you're just looking for a job any job, one evening of investigating their technologies is likely to get you that
[07:39.24] <Beoran__> Deithrian, or, the hard way, first learn programming , then learn a specific language for the web.
[07:39.37] <nitrxgen> lolwat
[07:39.38] <dis-pyon-tinuous> Beoran__: I don't see anything wrong with offering certain positions only to people who already work there.
[07:39.42] <Deithrian> _W_, interesting approach
[07:39.45] <_W_> (I once, with no python knowledge, applied for a python job; spent the evening before the interview reading up on it and writing a quick library to show off, and was told I was overqualified for the job)
[07:39.47] <dis-pyon-tinuous> Beoran__: What's there to hide?
[07:40.13] * aquinas (~aquinas_@cable-192.222.140.141.electronicbox.net) Quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[07:40.17] <Deithrian> Beoran__, I did try to go with the "01010101", but that didn't get me anywhere, and people are making websites every week with those frameworks.
[07:40.21] <Beoran__> dis-pyon-tinuous, the thing that is wrong is that it's a tactic to skirt a policy that was intituted to allow outsoders to have a chance
[07:40.28] <Deithrian> *got me
[07:40.40] <ecogiko> _W_: nice! Reminds me of what I am doing right now :D
[07:40.46] <dis-pyon-tinuous> Beoran__: Then the problem is the policy?
[07:40.49] <nitrxgen> _W_, nice
[07:40.58] <Rainb> _W_: That's kinda sad
[07:41.07] <Beoran__> dis-pyon-tinuous, perhaps, but while it is in place, it should be followed.
[07:41.12] * aquinas (~aquinas_@cable-192.222.140.141.electronicbox.net) has joined channel ##programming
[07:41.18] <Rounin> Overqualified... What a wonderfully opaque concept
[07:41.20] --Nazgul-- logged in with account (Nazgul)
[07:41.28] <nitrxgen> Rainb, not if he already knew other similar  languages
[07:41.29] <Rounin> I mean, at the face of it, do some companies want to pay more to get less?
[07:41.29] <Beoran__> Rounin, it just means "too expensive"
[07:41.33] <Rounin> Ah...
[07:41.34] --kkuno-- logged in with account (kkuno)
[07:41.37] <nitrxgen> plus, their expectations are probably low
[07:41.38] <Rounin> There had to be some logic
[07:41.50] <dis-pyon-tinuous> Because, seriously, some positions only make sense for people who are already familiar with the system. At one of my previous employers, they brought an outsider for a top-level management position, and the result was a disaster. [Though, to be fair, it wasn't entirely his fault.]
[07:41.52] <Beoran__> they needed a cheap , mediocre programmer
[07:42.04] <Beoran__> dis-pyon-tinuous, indeed at that
[07:42.14] <Rainb> why would people ever need a mediocre programmer tho
[07:42.19] <Rainb> just asking
[07:42.24] <Rainb> like data entry or some stuff?
[07:42.30] * Sadale (~Sadale@unaffiliated/sadale) has joined channel ##programming
[07:42.31] <Beoran__> Rainb, if  pice is more important than quality
[07:42.35] <dis-pyon-tinuous> Rainb: Because you want the thing done at the least cost possible?
[07:42.50] <nitrxgen> expert programmer
[07:42.51] <Beoran__> dis-pyon-tinuous, indeed
[07:42.56] <ecogiko> what makes a programmer mediocre?
[07:43.02] <Deithrian> I'm just tired of reading about functions and vars and classes in 1000 different languages and never getting anything done. Rails for example gave me an idea of how things work and how data flows.
[07:43.16] <Rainb> ecogiko: what about, not finishing on the deadlines
[07:43.22] <Beoran__> Deithrian, focus on 1 language and learn that in depth
[07:43.30] <Deithrian> Would you say that PHP is the easiest, meaning most available, way of getting a web dev job?
[07:43.48] <nitrxgen> probably, yeah, since php devs are wanted everywhere
[07:43.48] <Deithrian> For beginners?
[07:43.49] <dis-pyon-tinuous> Rainb: Actually, price matters more than quality in most situations and for most people. It's only when it comes to stuff like food, water, etc. that quality matters more - and, even then, only if you can afford it.
[07:44.25] * RumpledElf (~leethacks@unaffiliated/leethacksaw) Quit (Quit: Any sufficiently advanced incompetence is indistinguishable from malice)
[07:44.31] <Rainb> So _W_ was overqualified cause he asked for a high wage or sumthing
[07:44.40] <Beoran__> I personally reccomend any beginning programmer to bite the bullet and learn ANSI C (not c++) . If you master that, you'll be able to master any popular language.
[07:44.46] <ecogiko> Rainb: You can be an excellent programmer but still take a bite bigger than your mouth.
[07:44.52] <Beoran__> Rainb, higher than they expected to pay, yes.
[07:45.00] <Deithrian> Beoran__, I'm trying to pick the language right now. I thought I will learn Ruby because it's easy to read imo, but then the job offers for ruby devs are really rare compared to PHP
[07:45.36] <dis-pyon-tinuous> Deithrian: All programmers my age I know in real life know at least one of Ruby and Python, and many of them know both.
[07:45.36] --Nazgul-- logged in with account (Nazgul)
[07:45.37] <Beoran__> Deithrian, if you just want to make money, don' t become a programmer
[07:45.40] <Deithrian> Then I thought I will learn PHP, and then saw the trends on indeed and got confused
[07:45.42] <dis-pyon-tinuous> Deithrian: Hardly "rare".
[07:45.50] <Rainb> learning a language is not that, hard, except if it's haskell, or prolog, or other esoteric languages, you'll do okay
[07:46.13] <Beoran__> Indeed, and ruby jobs tend to pay better than PHP ones.
[07:46.15] <Deithrian> Beoran__, I'm not after money, not at all.
[07:46.30] <Beoran__> Deithrian, then learn the language that is most fun to you.
[07:47.18] <Beoran__> and see later what jobs it may or may not land you
[07:47.25] <dis-pyon-tinuous> Rainb: Haskell and Prolog are actually easy - the main issue is that they're too different from what most people encounter first. And, in Prolog's case, also the lack of libraries.
[07:48.14] * ashmew2 (~ashmew2@unaffiliated/ashmew2) Quit (Ping timeout: 276 seconds)
[07:48.31] <nitrxgen> ＋＋http://i.imgur.com/rrJgnaG.jpg，，
[07:48.33] <Beoran__> dis-pyon-tinuous, hence, they could rightfully be called "esoteric"
[07:48.39] <wei2912> nope
[07:48.53] <Deithrian> dis-pyon-tinuous, the job market I want to eventually enter is "rare" with Ruby positions, which is sad. There's plenty of PHP jobs though. That's why I went on indeed to see the trends.
[07:49.01] <wei2912> esoteric is reserved for (=<`#9]~6ZY32Vx/4Rs+0No-&Jk)"Fh}|Bcy?`=*z]Kw%oG4UUS0/@-ejc(:'8dc
[07:49.14] <dis-pyon-tinuous> Beoran__: When it comes to programming languages, "esoteric" means "deliberately designed to be hard to understand".
[07:49.24] <Deithrian> Beoran__, isn't Node a javascript thing? Why is it replacing PHP and ASP when everyone on the internet is screaming how horrible javascript is?
[07:49.26] <Rainb> >haskell
[07:49.28] <wei2912> haskell isn't hard to understand
[07:49.29] <dis-pyon-tinuous> Beoran__: Or "hard to use".
[07:49.33] <wei2912> malbolge is
[07:49.51] * Jackneill (~Jackneill@unaffiliated/jackneill) has joined channel ##programming
[07:50.07] <Beoran__> Deithrian, well because to do web apps you need to know javascript anyway for the browser, so if you know that you can do it on the server now as well with node.js
[07:50.09] <wei2912> it's a machine language for a ternary virtual machine...
[07:50.12] <dis-pyon-tinuous> Beoran__: Most Haskell code is super easy to understand. [At standard Haskell. Perhaps not if you go crazy with language extensions.]
[07:50.24] <Beoran__> no need to learn 2 languages like with ruby or php or java
[07:50.42] * atrx (~atrx@ppp-171-96-167-3.revip8.asianet.co.th) has joined channel ##programming
[07:51.00] --fidel_-- logged in with account (odb|fidel)
[07:51.22] <Beoran__> dis-pyon-tinuous, I dislike monads, the reality of programming is that state is everything.
[07:51.27] * antranigv (~antranigv@2a03:b0c0:0:1010::13:1) has left ##programming ()
[07:51.34] <wei2912> i beg to differ
[07:51.50] <Deithrian> Beoran__, that sounds good, but I tried reading an AJAX security book and what they essentially said is that a hacker can do whatever they want in javascript and you can't stop them on the client side. Why is it a good idea to use that language on the server side?
[07:52.02] * corey84_ (~Corey84@unaffiliated/corey84) has joined channel ##programming
[07:52.09] <wei2912> monads isn't only about state
[07:52.22] <Beoran__> Deithrian, if it's on the server then the hacker can't control it normally
[07:52.52] <Beoran__> .. if the server is secured well
[07:53.37] <Beoran__> ton the client side, yes, anyone can do wha tthey want there, so "never trust the client" is the main rule of secure web programming
[07:53.39] <Deithrian> Beoran__, so if PHP or JAVA or the other languages were used on the client side like JS is being used they would have the same problems?
[07:53.45] * Corey84 (~Corey84@unaffiliated/corey84) Quit (Disconnected by services)
[07:53.47] * corey84_ is now known as Corey84
[07:53.56] <dis-pyon-tinuous> Beoran__: Monads aren't really about state. (Though state transformers happen to be monadic.) It's just a design pattern that happens to arise all the time - sometimes in state transformers, sometimes in other kinds of code.
[07:55.05] <Beoran__> Well they are for me what makes Haskell hard to understand.
[07:55.59] <Rainb> Well, it's true
[07:56.03] * vgdb (~vgdb@73.195.171.87) Quit (Quit: My MacBook has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[07:56.06] <Rainb> Never ever trust javascript
[07:56.11] <rindolf> Beoran__: from what I know programming the server in the same language of the client is not the main point of Node.js.
[07:56.18] <dis-pyon-tinuous> Also, seriously, what's the fixation with monads? IO is lots of things besides a Monad: a Functor, an Applicative, a MonadZero (the latter is questionable, though)...
[07:56.25] <Rainb> Chrome Console can easily inject javascript
[07:56.35] <Rainb> there are also userscripts and plugins
[07:57.08] <Rainb> For example
[07:57.40] --Niebuhr-- logged in with account (Niebuhr)
[07:57.51] <Deithrian> Is JavaScript not secure as a whole or just when it's on the client side?
[07:58.18] <Rainb> I meant client side
[07:58.40] <Rainb> Server side, is only as secure as who accesses the servers I suppose
[07:58.55] <Rainb> Can you do a internet test that only lasts a minute (in order to avoid googling or whatever) on the web?
[07:59.30] <Rainb> I'd say no, if the device the test is running is not trusted.
[08:00.16] <nitrxgen> man, dunno how im gonna do this database stuff
[08:00.56] * Betal (~Beta@unaffiliated/betal) has joined channel ##programming

[08:04.22] * MissionCritical (~MissionCr@unaffiliated/missioncritical) Quit (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[08:04.25] <Deithrian> web dev is so much fun. All the languages, frameworks, and databases :)
[08:04.45] --Tjommi-- logged in with account (Tjommi)
[08:04.56] <nitrxgen> i get another 16 GB RAM tomorrow :D thinking about ordering another 6TB HDD
[08:05.06] <Rainb> I still think node.js is not as fast
[08:05.17] <Rainb> but it's probably faster than most of the alternatives
[08:05.25] <Rainb> I mean just look at php
[08:05.43] <nitrxgen> php can be fast if you do things right
[08:06.14] <nitrxgen> and depends what you're doing
[08:06.27] <nitrxgen> for most web purposes, if you make something slow in php, you're probably doing it wrong
[08:06.53] <Deithrian> nitrxgen, is there training out there that teaches how to do it right?
[08:07.03] <nitrxgen> anyway, is sunny outsied, gonna go vroom vroom on motabiek
[08:08.13] <nitrxgen> Deithrian, dont really know to be honest, I have like nearly a decade of php experience under my hat, doing benchmarks, changing techniques and stuff, some things are much better practice than others
[08:08.37] * crystal77 (~crystal77@107-218-136-245.lightspeed.austtx.sbcglobal.net) has joined channel ##programming

[08:08.42] * red_horned_rihno (~red_horne@unaffiliated/red-horned-rihno/x-2983785) Quit (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[08:08.55] <Deithrian> nitrxgen, thanks.
[08:09.26] --{0}grant-- logged in with account ({0}grant)
[08:09.33] --ep0-- logged in with account (ep0)
[08:09.39] <nitrxgen> i didnt learn any of it in college/school, php.net is inarguably one of the best manuals out there
[08:10.09] <Rainb> >asking for training
[08:10.12] <Rainb> Ayy lmao
[08:10.19] <nitrxgen> put some code together, see how it fails, see how it works, use your brain to figure out the logic of ops and why a certain way is better than another
[08:10.51] --austeritysucks-- logged in with account (AusteritySucks)
[08:10.55] * rgr (~user@f054152139.adsl.alicedsl.de) has joined channel ##programming
[08:10.56] <Airon> Trying to work out text game mechanics. There's not really many good resources for this stuff, so I'm having to fill in the gaps.
[08:11.05] <Airon> How does this logic look?: ＋＋http://hastebin.com/izewivafas.pl，，
[08:11.27] <Airon> (Three different ideas on how to do it, different scales)
[08:11.38] <wei2912> Airon: let me take a look
[08:11.44] <Airon> thanks
[08:11.51] <nitrxgen> text game mechanic? never played the original lol
[08:12.02] --paeniz-- logged in with account (paeniz)
[08:12.14] <Rainb> I learned programming here, voicing my doubts here, the worse that happened was being told to RTFM/google and being insulted cause I didn't understood some simple program or whatever
[08:12.24] <Beoran__> Deithrian, yes, for example, now with nacl of emscripten you can compile C down tpo something that runs on theclient side and has similar problems
[08:12.39] --johnflux__-- logged in with account (JohnFlux)
[08:12.46] <Rainb> Which in retroespective, it wasn't that bad.
[08:12.50] * zima (zima@173.182.129.50) has joined channel ##programming
[08:12.50] <wei2912> Airon: usually we index the grid from top to bottom and left to right
[08:13.16] * enterprisedc (~enterpris@ip68-109-198-52.oc.oc.cox.net) Quit (Quit: enterprisedc)
[08:13.18] <Airon> Alright. But it would work?
[08:13.23] <Deithrian> nitrxgen, thanks, I'm hoping that PHP frameworks will teach me some goof practices. I did write a "game thingy" with interface in Python, but I'm pretty sure that it's not supposed to be 600+ lines of code, although it works...
[08:13.38] * MissionCritical (~MissionCr@unaffiliated/missioncritical) has joined channel ##programming
[08:13.54] <Rainb> I don't want to use php frameworks, just libraries
[08:14.07] * HoloIRCUser3 (~holoirc@106.215.188.252) has joined channel ##programming
[08:14.26] <nitrxgen> Deithrian, my database engine is written entirely in php, it's holding about 500 billion bits of text, 4-5 TBs big
[08:14.29] <Deithrian> Beoran__, that's good to know. As it was described in that security book, JavaScript was painted as the worst thing in the universe where everything can mutate and be changed.
[08:14.34] * HoloIRCUser3 is now known as rikodo
[08:14.38] <porkbonk> Deithrian, maybe have a look at Slim. Comes with essentials you need and easily lets you do your own thing
[08:14.42] <wei2912> Airon: read till the grid, probably. you need to be wary of impossible coordinates. i suggest you write a helper function to access the room
[08:14.47] <nitrxgen> Deithrian, it finds any text in about 50-60 milliseconds
[08:14.52] <Beoran__> Deithrian, security has not much to do with language but more with proper use
[08:15.13] <wei2912> Airon: actually, that isn't necessary if you're catching exceptions
[08:15.35] <Rainb> I used a php framework which checked for the existence of files everytime, and it made pageload extremely slow
[08:15.47] <Beoran__> Airon, is this a text game?
[08:15.49] <Deithrian> *good practices
[08:15.54] <Airon> Beoran__: Yeah
[08:16.04] * FreeFull (~freefull@defocus/sausage-lover) Quit (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[08:16.19] <Airon> Like, old school text adventure
[08:16.49] <Beoran__> Then you need lists of exits since the grid may not be rectangular
[08:16.51] <Airon> Is what I'm going for. I've found several tutorials on making them and they all stop after a couple videos. Don't know why
[08:17.24] <Rainb> I think it was that popular one, codeigniter, yes.
[08:17.36] * crystal77 (~crystal77@107-218-136-245.lightspeed.austtx.sbcglobal.net) Quit (Quit: Computer has gone to sleep.)
[08:17.40] <nitrxgen> hehe, gonna hear my new helmet today :D
[08:17.50] <Beoran__> Airon, text adventures hardest point is parsig the user's input
[08:18.16] <Beoran__> for the rest it's a graph-like data strcture
[08:18.38] <Deithrian> I'm at the place where I know what a var is, function is, class is, and I can write code that """"works""". Which of the PHP frameworks would you recommend as having best practices in it, in terms of writing PHP?
[08:19.01] <Airon> Beoran__: Okay. It's going to be pretty short, and most of it will be keyfinding, looking around, opening doors, going through dialog.
[08:19.03] <porkbonk> Deithrian, like I said, check out Slim
[08:19.06] <Beoran__> Deithrian, ask around #php maybe?
[08:19.42] <Deithrian> ok thank you porkbonk and Beoran__
[08:19.48] * Betal (~Beta@unaffiliated/betal) Quit (Disconnected by services)
[08:20.03] <Beoran__> Airon, then you cpuld kep it mimited to a simple verb adjective object indirect object parser
[08:20.17] <porkbonk> ＋＋http://www.slimframework.com，， use composer to manage your packages / libraries and have a look around packagist.org for anything you need
[08:20.46] <Airon> Beoran__: Sorry. I don't know what that means
[08:21.02] * Betal (~Beta@unaffiliated/betal) has joined channel ##programming
[08:21.06] <Beoran__> typos
[08:21.20] <Beoran__> I'm holding our 3 months old
[08:21.33] * Seacow (~Seacow@unaffiliated/seacow) Quit (Ping timeout: 255 seconds)
[08:21.33] <Deithrian> thanks porkbonk, hopefully there's good tutorials for it out there too.
[08:21.45] <Airon> Oh, lovely. It's fun holding kids, but they have a habit of cutting off my circulation.
[08:22.02] <porkbonk> Deithrian, the documentation is quite good
[08:22.08] <Beoran__> Airon, then you could keep it limited to a simple parser here thre word order always is verb (object) (indirect object)
[08:22.45] <Airon> I guess I should look up some tutorials on objects. I know a lot about how I want things to work, but I suck at learning syntax and terminology
[08:22.51] <Beoran__> he loves barfing all over the place good he had an xl bib
[08:23.14] <Beoran__> Airon, I mean E nglish language objects, not OOP
[08:23.22] <porkbonk> Deithrian, and trust me, you'll want to use Composer and look into autoloading if you're know using it
[08:23.25] <Beoran__> like open the door with key
[08:23.34] <porkbonk> makes things so much more comfortable in the long run
[08:23.41] * whowho (7bf39866@gateway/web/freenode/ip.123.243.152.102) Quit (Quit: Page closed)
[08:23.44] * tortoise (~x@host-239.180-235-182.cable.dynamic.kbtelecom.net) Quit ()
[08:24.05] <Beoran__> open the door with key -> open : verb / the door -> object -> with key -> indirect object
[08:24.55] * oriig (~oriig@5.53.176.8) Quit (Remote host closed the connection)
[08:24.58] <Airon> Beoran__: Ah, right, okay. I guess I'll have a think about how that should work
[08:25.21] * red_horned_rihno (~red_horne@unaffiliated/red-horned-rihno/x-2983785) has joined channel ##programming
[08:25.30] <Deithrian> porkbonk, I saw an article with someone mentioning autoloading, will keep those in mind thanks!
[08:26.39] <Beoran__> Airon, then keep a list of verbs that map the verbs to functions
[08:26.50] <porkbonk> basically instead of having a bunch of include() and require() you include the autoloader once and just start using classes. the autoloader will include the files for you as you use them
[08:27.33] <Beoran__> Airon, what language do you program in?

[08:29.23] <Airon> I don't know, honestly. Don't know what a hashmap is. I'll google it
[08:29.38] <porkbonk> it's a Dictionary in .NET
[08:29.47] <Beoran__> the basic routine for test games is read in a line ,parse it, call the right functiion, influence ghame state and produce output, then repeat again
[08:30.05] <Beoran__> porkbonk, yes, that's another name for it
[08:30.17] <Deithrian> porkbonk, good to know, and there seems to be plenty of tutorials out there. I guess PHP it is, and if it goes out of style by the time I can be productive with it, maybe it will be easier to switch to Node or w/e.
[08:30.34] <Airon> Beoran__: Yeah, I wrote some logic similar to that before

[08:31.37] <porkbonk> Deithrian, php has a lot of stigma, but if you follow current best practices you'll be just fine
[08:31.46] <Deithrian> ok rindolf, what would you recommend?
[08:31.50] * chris_99 (~chris_99@unaffiliated/chris-99/x-3062929) has joined channel ##programming
[08:32.04] <rindolf> Deithrian: Python perhaps.
[08:32.05] <Beoran__> Airon, fair enough

[08:32.22] <rindolf> Deithrian: what do you know already?
[08:32.39] <MeaCoder> hi,what is correct role for adding version to programs?? for ex: i have an app with version 1.0 , if i edited app and add a new function then what version must add??
[08:32.43] <Deithrian> rindolf, I don't see any Python job offers in the market I will be targeting unfortunately.
[08:32.54] <rindolf> MeaCoder: version 1.1?
[08:32.58] <Beoran__> MeaCoder, it's arbitrary
[08:33.04] <rindolf> Deithrian: do you see Django ones?
[08:33.05] <Beoran__> but there are standard you could follow
[08:33.08] * Filystyn (~piotr@031011212161.warszawa.vectranet.pl) has joined channel ##programming
[08:33.11] <Beoran__> like the semver standard
[08:33.30] <Beoran__> ＋＋http://semver.org/，，
[08:33.31] <Deithrian> rindolf, nope, it's PHP all the way and one offer for Rails.
[08:33.41] <rindolf> Deithrian: ah.
[08:33.55] <Airon> Apparently '(hash)maps' are similar to dictionaries
[08:34.10] <Airon> Where you have a value and a key?
[08:34.37] <rindolf> The dictionary abstract data type is knowns by several names : dictionary, map, associative array, hash, etc.
[08:34.41] <Rainb> the key is the hash
[08:34.47] <porkbonk> Airon, it lets you access values by key of any type, yes
[08:34.50] <rindolf> Rainb: what?
[08:35.04] <porkbonk> pretty much like a telephone book
[08:35.05] <Rainb> you hash the key, and the map to the hash is the value
[08:35.09] <Airon> Okay, cool. What would rooms be? Classes?
[08:35.15] <rindolf> Rainb: no.
[08:35.22] * EquuaPotesta_lap (~E_P@97-84-42-130.static.stls.mo.charter.com) Quit (Ping timeout: 264 seconds)
[08:35.50] <rindolf> Rainb: you map the value to the key, but sometimes use the hash integer to determine where to store it internally.
[08:35.56] <Beoran__> Airon, the key would be the string of the verb's name , and the values you look up are the functions to call when the verb is used by the player
[08:35.59] <Airon> Or, I mean, you make a room class, and then objects from that? Sorry if I'm being dumb
[08:36.18] <Beoran__> Airon, that's an implementation detail, depnds on the language
[08:36.24] <Deithrian> porkbonk, there seems to be plenty of tutorials for PHP. I think I may be able to learn best practices before I can destroy my code writing with my own solutions :)
[08:36.30] <Beoran__> In C I would make rooms and in-ggame items both structs
[08:36.45] <porkbonk> Airon, var rooms = new Dictionary<string,Room>();
[08:36.49] <Rainb> you don't store the key
[08:36.57] * Jackneill (~Jackneill@unaffiliated/jackneill) Quit (Quit: Leaving)
[08:37.06] <rindolf> Rainb: yes you do.
[08:37.19] <rindolf> Rainb: there could be two keys with the same hash.
[08:37.19] <porkbonk> Airon, rooms.Add("living room", new Room()); would add "living room" as the key and a new room as its value

[08:38.27] <porkbonk> with properties of a room that you can fill

[10:36.00] <Twey> python000: If you know your compiler aligns to 4-boundaries you can try to arrange your data so that padding is minimized, e.g. by putting the two things of size 6 next to each other so they form a thing of 12.

[03:09.36] <jrslepak> (they probably wouldn't use "civil engineer" for such a job, of course)
[03:09.40] <Aoso> Could you all share your thoughts on what languages a novice should learn please and your experiences if possible? :)
[03:09.57] <hyuke> Aoso: what kind of programs would you like to wrtie?
[03:09.57] <Leechmaster> hyuke: would you prefer your sub to be created by sub engineer or sub architect? xD
[03:09.59] <guest342156743> so what typically do software engineers do the programmers done if it is just documentation ,tech docs,...etc then rather be a programmer
[03:10.00] <hyuke> *write
[03:10.17] <jrslepak> guest342156743: in English please?
[03:10.31] <hyuke> Leechmaster: I think a sub architect would specialize in what ingredients to put on which sandwich :P
[03:10.32] <sssilver> Aoso: stay away from PHP and Perl and Visual Basic, the rest is OK
[03:10.36] <delta-nry> there is a difference to claiming being an engineer and being an actual accredited engineer

[03:12.01] <jrslepak> guest342156743: again, could you ask your question in English?
[03:12.26] <delta-nry> I would not claim to be an engineer if I wasn’t in an accredited program with a sufficiently good reputation
[03:12.46] <Aoso> Thanks hyuke, currently plowing through python but always nice to hear other peoples opinions :)
[03:13.08] <hyuke> Aoso: I recently made a decision to never use C or C++ again for a personal project because there are much better options. I'd like to say stay away from those, but I would be lying if I said that I didn't learn a lot from them

[03:20.56] <hyuke> nda_: you might be in a position where it seems like PHP is going to crop up a lot. Others are not in that position and view the world quite differently. At work I use C++ and Fortran and if they need some small task I have some freedom to pick the language
[03:21.11] <hyuke> nda_: We don't actually, because in my field Fortran is much more common than PHP

[03:22.17] <hyuke> nda_: on the other hand, Fortran is among the most popular
[03:22.21] <Aoso> if nothing else im learning just from both of your opinions how varied the answer in question may be

[03:22.53] <sssilver> _X_C_V_B_: as big as you can pay for
[03:22.58] <guest342156743> would i be safe to say that a system architect doesn't really code but more designs how the software will be developed i.e what libraries/functions to uses,what language , what systems will be used , what programming tools can be used for developing it..etc
[03:23.00] * MissionCritical (~MissionCr@unaffiliated/missioncritical) has joined channel ##programming
[03:23.15] <Lymia> I would hope not. That sounds like dead weight.
[03:23.26] <hyuke> Aoso: I think the most important thing is to stick with languages that are best at doing the sorts of things you want to do. And, if you find a language ugly and you are not required to write in it, just avoid it because it'll make programming not fun :P
[03:23.50] <guest342156743> and some what maybe even the structure of the project/code
[03:24.06] <hyuke> Aoso: it doesn't hurt to learn things like PHP either. My opinion is just that it's unnecessary unless you really want to get into web development or something
[03:24.15] <Aoso> massive thanks to both hyuke and nda_ , two very different yet applicable answers :)
[03:24.15] <guest342156743> though some software engineers do this to some extent
[03:24.31] <Xgc> niro: People use all sorts of methods.  ctags or shell commands or an IDE or editor that can navigate your C project.
[03:24.39] <Leechmaster> guest342156743: that depends on the size of the project, sometimes architects don't write code
[03:24.46] <sssilver> hyuke: PHP is unnecessary regardless of what you want to do
[03:24.50] <sssilver> and ugly
[03:24.59] <sssilver> and just a bad language
[03:25.10] <Aoso> lol
[03:25.19] <Leechmaster> PHP sucks :)
[03:25.27] <nda_> Well, as you can see, Aoso, many different opinions. :)
[03:25.32] <niro> xgc, yeah. I do all that stuff, but it seems such an ugly way to do it. Is there something a bit neater?
[03:25.37] <Leechmaster> (just to sum up)
[03:25.40] <Lymia> Too bad PHP code exists.
[03:25.41] <guest342156743> curious interms of documentation what normally does a programmer/software engineer write up other then code , and what documents does a software architect write up that normally a software engineer doesn't
[03:25.45] <port_408> hyuke: still PHP is not a clean language, at least I feel that way. It's okay if people are already into it, but I don't suggest it to a person looking for a career in web development

[03:45.21] <Richdog> if you don't mind teaching then you may have a shot
[03:45.25] <pulse> name one programming paradigm that can do all that :D

[03:57.30] <GeneralVagueness> there's a bunch of data if you scroll down
[03:57.32] <DogPolice> The distance between events in my life should be of no concern. :)
[03:58.56] <jrslepak> GeneralVagueness: analyzing the likely outcomes of following a range of options? yes, that is a thing many people get paid to do :-P
[03:59.24] <ecogiko> You are correct but that would give me an estimate if because I am following a path similar to yours that is something I can do, or do something else that might be more suited to me.
[03:59.40] <DogPolice> ecogiko: You can do what I'm doing in 20 years or less.
[03:59.47] <jrslepak> though there is probably less demand for specifically analysis of how to do well in a particular video game
[03:59.48] <DogPolice> Given a good standing point.
[03:59.54] <DogPolice> It's taken me longer than that to get here.
[04:00.15] <DogPolice> No road is smooth.
[04:01.02] <ecogiko> I had a later start so I my goals are still a bit foggy and I am just trying to measure things up as a I go.
[04:01.07] <tsousa> it's also that hard to find a remote work in a opensource project?

[05:06.02] <hyuke> DarkElement: I'm not sure you can do that without brute-force. It's one equation with three unknowns
[05:06.08] <_slade_> DarkElement: Well, number 9 can be done faster if you eliminate the cases where a, b == b, a from a previous iteration.
[05:06.31] <DarkElement> There are plenty of things I am going to eliminate
[05:06.32] <hyuke> DarkElement: It's also probably one line in haskell with a list comprehension

[05:07.37] <Lymia> 1000*999 I think
[05:07.39] <Lymia> This is trivial
[05:07.51] <DarkElement> What do you mean?

[05:12.18] <hyuke> brute force is pretty cheap, you know that a + b + c = 1000, so that's a limit on how many times you need to loop. So is a < b < c

[06:19.15] <gde33> a history rewriting machine

[06:22.40] * corey84_ (~Corey84@unaffiliated/corey84) Quit (Ping timeout: 246 seconds)
[06:22.48] <TimeOtter> it's stupid to take Wikipedia for the ARBITER of conclusions about data that has been gathered.  Even within NASA, some scientists will disagree with the interpretation of data by their colleagues.  You have to understand the process of science's determination of the meaning of measurements.
[06:22.49] <pyon-ted-type> django_: But just ask your question directly.
[06:23.00] <django_> pyon-ted-type for this problem: ＋＋https://www.dropbox.com/s/nhcjssyb1rxw02y/1.23.PNG?dl=0，， why are they using variables in the eigenvectors
[06:23.08] <_slade_> TimeOtter: Agreed.

[06:23.39] <jrslepak> gde33: it takes quite a bit more than "people disagree" to prove that a single edit conflict resolution process is wrong, and you went so far as to claim that they're *all* wrong
[06:23.54] <_slade_> As a resource for recent events that are mostly reported on by online sources whose claims carry dubious authenticity? Eh...
[06:24.01] <gde33> jrslepak: yes!
[06:24.11] <jrslepak> so back up your claim.
[06:24.15] <DogPolice> Wikipedia provides sources as a method of authenticity, just as any paper does.
[06:24.17] <pyon-ted-type> django_: Remember that, if v is an eigenvector, so is kv, for any scalar k.
[06:24.23] * Cronoh (~Cronoh@ip68-3-77-178.ph.ph.cox.net) has joined channel ##programming

[06:24.38] <JohnBobSmith> Hello everyone.
[06:24.40] <DogPolice> And then come back so you can reason about it effectively.
[06:24.50] <django_> pyon-ted-type why though? because there are repeating eigenvalues?
[06:25.04] <_slade_> DogPolice: The issue is with the selectiveness of sources that can occur when someone tries to slant an article a specific way.
[06:25.05] * MissionCritical (~MissionCr@unaffiliated/missioncritical) Quit (Max SendQ exceeded)
[06:25.19] <DogPolice> _slade_: So prove that there's a slant, propose an edit.
[06:25.27] <_slade_> Especially if it's an article that's bordering on non-notability.
[06:25.29] <DogPolice> And defend it.
[06:25.46] <DogPolice> If you're right, the truth will present itself. There has to be a fact present that details a slant.
[06:25.52] <gde33> DogPolice: then it gets deleted
[06:26.02] <_slade_> You get these people who WP:OWN articles and build up cults of personality around themselves, and any attempt at fixing the damage that person has done will be called out as targeting a specific editor.

[06:26.32] <JohnBobSmith> I'm wondering, when, why, and how one should use C++ exceptions? I've read that exceptions are for just that. Exceptional errors. But, what classifies as such an error? Also, is it true that using exceptions reduces code portability, and makes code harder to read? This is specifically in a game engine context.
[06:26.37] <DogPolice> gde33: So you're saying you.. have no evidence.
[06:26.47] <DogPolice> Good. So this discussion is closed. For everyone.

[06:27.01] <DogPolice> gde33: So propose an edit, throw it up on Reddit, make it public.
[06:27.07] <DogPolice> This is not the forum you use to slander a source of information.
[06:27.12] <gde33> DogPolice: it seems beyond the scope of this channel
[06:27.24] <_slade_> Criticism isn't slander.
[06:27.38] <DogPolice> _slade_: Without any evidence to present, yes it is.
[06:27.50] <_slade_> Wikipedia has ARBCOM to settle the big disputes, but ARBCOM is a big hammer.
[06:27.59] <_slade_> They can't cover every edit war that occurs, and some articles get left in an abysmal state as a result.
[06:28.00] <pyon-ted-type> django_: Oh, my bad.
[06:28.02] <DogPolice> I don't know what started it, but I'm ending it. Conversation over.
[06:28.12] <gde33> DogPolice: it is a wonderful resource for many things, dont get the wrong idea

[09:19.22] <lf94> combining streams, subscribing to stream, etc
[09:19.43] <vdamewood> ProgramminInC: The error message you got, which is slightly cryptic, means that you're trying to access a property in something that isn't a struct or union, that is the things that have properties. heap isn't a struct or a union, it's a pointer. So, you can't get its properties. *heap is a struct however.

[09:20.51] <ProgramminInC> vdamewood: So the problem was I need to access the heap itself before accessing the property

[09:22.09] <TimeOtter> lf94: problem with OOP is that people make layers upon layers of abstraction.  Pretty soon you can not figure out how the devils this object does what it's claimed it does.
[09:22.13] <vdamewood> ProgramminInC: You might want to use clang instead of gcc. It has nicer error messages.

[09:26.26] <[boxed-pyon]> TimeOtter: The problem with OOP is that it makes it hard to design non-leaky abstractions. Inheritance as a code reuse mechanism encourages a style in which you don't worry much about leaks, because they will be patched in a subclass.

[10:11.51] <delta-nry> not the same at all
[10:12.17] <vdamewood> Also, structs in C# are more like classes in Java than structs in C.
[10:12.20] <delta-nry> but iirc eveything in Java are reference types so it doesnt matter
[10:12.43] <vdamewood> For example, Structs in C# can have member functions.

[10:13.23] <reaga> vdamewood: please stop talking
[10:13.47] <[boxed-pyon]> reaga: Structs are there a *semantic* improvement over Java: structs have value semantics, which makes them a conceptually more accurate tool in many situations, regardless of efficiency.
[10:14.13] <vdamewood> delta-nry: the primitive types, eg, int, float, double, etc. Are 'value' types.
[10:14.30] <delta-nry> vdamewood: no user-definable value types then
[10:14.34] <[boxed-pyon]> reaga: If you want to create value objects in Java, you need to remember to override .equals(), .hashCode(), possibly implement Comparable...
[10:14.39] <reaga> [boxed-pyon]: because there were no structs in java, i had to make arrays that simulated structs
[10:14.43] <vdamewood> delta-nry: In Java, nope.
[10:14.44] <[boxed-pyon]> reaga: And == will still be broken for them.
[10:14.56] <[boxed-pyon]> reaga: Arrays don't simulate structs.
[10:15.18] <[boxed-pyon]> Basically, in the JVM, the only thing reasonably close to structs is Scala's case classes.
[10:15.31] <reaga> so, instead of having an array of people. like this people[] p = new people[100], i had to make lots of arrays like this: int[] age = new int[100], double[] height = new double[100].... etc
[10:15.32] <vdamewood> I'm guessing reaga is either just trolling or doesn't know how to program. Either way, meh.
[10:15.38] <[boxed-pyon]> reaga: [And they are still a leaky abstraction, although the language does a good job of hiding the leak the best that it can.]
[10:15.44] <reaga> that data would have been in a people struct, but java doest have structs
[10:15.57] <[boxed-pyon]> reaga: Errr... that's simply bad code.

[10:17.21] <reaga> [boxed-pyon]: i know
[10:17.22] <reaga> exactly
[10:17.46] <[boxed-pyon]> reaga: Well, in that case you can use a C++ std::array<people, N>, where N is your big-ass number.
[10:18.03] <[boxed-pyon]> reaga: Statically allocated *and* contiguous *and* works exactly as you'd expect.

[10:19.55] <[boxed-pyon]> reaga: Or, if you're willing to be even fancier, you can use a "char buffer[M];" where M is a constexpr equal to sizeof(person) times your big-ass number. And then you use placement new on top of this.
[10:20.07] <[boxed-pyon]> reaga: But have fun debugging your code!

[11:02.05] <nitrxgen> yeah, that
[11:02.18] <haneefmubarak> Instead of using a FIFO with some sort of synchronization barrier, could I use two arrays and switch them out each time one gets empty? ie: producer writes to A, consumers read from B; consumers exhaust B: producer locks A&B, consumers pause, producer switches A&B, producer unlocks A&B; producer fills A: producer sits tight until B is empty than does the previous
[11:02.29] <[boxed-pyon]> Well, it's annoying that some operators sometimes require parentheses (e.g., sizeof), but other operators don't.
[11:02.52] <nitrxgen> ser_berry, function o($i){return$i.@(($j=abs($i)%100)>10&&$j<14?th:[th,st,nd,rd][$j%10]?:th);}
[11:03.05] <ser_berry> gross what is that
[11:03.21] <nitrxgen> why? no parentheses on the return?
[11:03.22] <nitrxgen> lol
[11:03.44] <vdamewood> I found ditching parens on return quite easy once i realized how useless it was.
[11:03.50] <ser_berry> well aside from being incomprehensible, the presence of the error suppression operator is always disconcerting
[11:04.02] <[boxed-pyon]> What's this? Perl? PHP?
[11:04.06] <ser_berry> this is PHP
[11:04.13] <[boxed-pyon]> Oh, God.
[11:04.21] <nitrxgen> ser_berry, indeed, it was a test to see how much i could shorten a simple function
[11:04.24] <[boxed-pyon]> Apparently, PHP allows much more room for "creativity" than I previously thought.

[11:06.14] <nitrxgen> yes
[11:06.18] <nitrxgen> broken?
[11:06.24] <ser_berry> yes I'd say so
[11:06.30] <[boxed-pyon]> PHP's ternary opeartor is left-associative.
[11:06.40] <[boxed-pyon]> In every other language that has it, it's right-associative.

[11:06.59] <ser_berry> lol @ this site
[11:07.01] <[boxed-pyon]> And, to be frank, it makes more sense for it to be right-associative.
[11:07.13] <nitrxgen> it doesnt really take advantage of that, it would just be in a different order otherwise
[11:07.17] <[boxed-pyon]> That way you can chain ?:s as an expression-level if-else-if...
[11:07.25] <[boxed-pyon]> Ah.
[11:07.26] <Richard_2340985> php is broken beyond possible repair

[11:14.50] <ser_berry> date('S') is English ordinal suffix for the day of the month, 2 characters

[11:15.18] <nitrxgen> ser_berry, right, yes
[11:15.32] <nitrxgen> from a speed perspective, date() is slow

[11:15.51] <ser_berry> I see
[11:15.58] <nitrxgen> and you need to pass in a timestamp-formatted int to get what you want

[11:16.52] <nitrxgen> thats ok if you want the ordinal /date/ instead of an ordinal integer
[11:17.43] <ser_berry> it's been a long time since I've thought about PHP so I am probably confused

[11:19.32] <nitrxgen> no :p problem avoided
[11:19.53] <rangergord> is there a data structure like a map, but optimized for retrieving the k/v pairs of multiple keys at the same time? if so what's its name?

[11:22.15] <nitrxgen> you could use date('S',($i-1)*60*60*24)
[11:22.21] * redpill (~redpill@unaffiliated/redpill) Quit (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[11:23.01] <nitrxgen> but... with larger integers, im not sure how it would handle leap magnitudes... i guess it will lose accuracy
[11:23.05] <lf94> What are all the higher order functions again? fold, filter and map?
[11:23.17] <nitrxgen> since its not treating it like an int, but a date
[11:24.49] <nitrxgen> id rather use a function that i know will give me what i want though lol
[11:25.31] <ser_berry> did you try anything else?
[11:25.37] <ser_berry> if not, how will you know?

[11:26.07] <ser_berry> it seems to me that the native implementation would often be faster than anything implemented in PHP
[11:26.12] <nisstyre> lf94: there's an infinite number of them because a HOF is just a function that takes or returns a function
[11:26.15] <haneefmubarak> rangergord: have you had a look at a hashtable or, better yet, a crit-bit tree?
[11:26.28] <lf94> ah
[11:26.39] <nisstyre> ones that take and return functions are usually called combinators
[11:26.50] <lf94> I thought HOF was take an array return something
[11:26.55] <nisstyre> no
[11:26.57] <lf94> array+function = value
[11:27.19] <lf94> ok

[11:27.44] <rangergord> haneefmubarak: I've been using a hashtable. When I want eg 100 items, I do a lookup for each one in a loop. I was considering a map-based structure that lets me look up multiple keys simultaneously, so I could compare performance
[11:27.47] <nisstyre> for example the function "const" which is just const a _ = a
[11:27.49] <nisstyre> in Haskell
[11:28.02] <lf94> right
[11:28.03] <nisstyre> it takes a parameter a and returns a function that ignores its parameter and returns a
[11:28.18] <nisstyre> that's a HOF
[11:28.26] <lf94> alright

[11:30.15] <DarkElement> Good stuff
[11:30.16] <nisstyre> watch it again
[11:30.22] <rangergord> DarkElement: the one about that awkward high school dude who ends up surrounded by a ton of anime girls
[11:30.25] <lf94> oh wow PHP has a compose() function

[11:30.41] <nisstyre> lf94: PHP doesn't have closures though
[11:30.49] <rangergord> DarkElement: that's the one!
[11:30.49] <Lady_Aleena> Hello again, hello.
[11:30.58] <rangergord> but seriously, don't waste your time on anime
[11:31.00] <lf94> nisstyre, apparently it does?
[11:31.05] <lf94> function() use() {}
[11:31.06] <nisstyre> nope, I argue not
[11:31.16] <nisstyre> you probably don't want to get into this with me though
[11:31.19] <lf94> ok
[11:31.20] <lf94> X)
[11:31.24] <nisstyre> but PHP definitely does not have lexical scope
[11:31.58] <haneefmubarak> rangergord: you're going to have to lookup in a loop anyways for any random access structure
[11:32.07] * Vile` (~Vile@unaffiliated/vile/x-1886500) has joined channel ##programming
[11:32.21] <haneefmubarak> rangergord: perhaps you need a faster hash or a crit-bit tree
[11:32.25] * someoneigna (~someoneig@186.125.153.225) has joined channel ##programming
[11:33.33] <nitrxgen> ser_berry, make the same function using what you think would work better and I'll compare it
[11:33.54] <ser_berry> I don't know if I understand your problem well enough to do that
[11:34.01] <ser_berry> also I haven't coded PHP in at least 5 years
[11:34.15] <nitrxgen> it's not my problem, other people think there's a problem with my solution
[11:34.19] <rangergord> I think I'd better look at a faster hash, yeah...crit-bit tree seems pretty obscure and would require manual work/wrapping, not comfortable using something like that (it's not a hobby project, I got a collaborator)
[11:34.27] <nitrxgen> so I just want to see how others would do it
[11:34.45] <nitrxgen> also the date() method looses accuracy as i thought

[11:35.11] <nisstyre> PHP is a clusterfuck
[11:35.19] <nisstyre> you're never quite sure what your code is doing
[11:35.21] <nitrxgen> it ends up losing accuracy at 32 :P giving 32st, 33nd, 34rd
[11:35.39] <ser_berry> do you have a link for that nitrxgen ?
[11:35.52] <nitrxgen> for what
[11:36.03] <ser_berry> the claim that date('S') loses accuracy under some circumstances
[11:36.14] <nisstyre> what does the $ indicate?
[11:36.16] <nitrxgen> <nitrxgen> you could use date('S',($i-1)*60*60*24)
[11:36.16] <ser_berry> that sounds like a pretty big issue
[11:36.22] <haneefmubarak> rangergord: what language are you using?
[11:36.23] <ser_berry> nisstyre: in PHP the $ indicates a variable
[11:36.28] <nisstyre> yeah but
[11:36.35] <nisstyre> actually no fuck it
[11:36.38] <nisstyre> I don't want to know
[11:36.45] <ser_berry> haha
[11:36.45] <nitrxgen> anyone else wants to uselessly bash php can go wait in the corner with nisstyre
[11:36.47] <ser_berry> I don't blame you
[11:37.20] <nisstyre> nitrxgen: I actually made a pull request to the PHP spec trying to make it clearer
[11:37.24] <nisstyre> but they just argued with me
[11:37.29] <nitrxgen> lol
[11:37.42] <rangergord> haneefmubarak: C++. I've been using strings as keys, but since they're fixed, I could wrap them in a class that uses an int as an identifier and use that for hashing, and move the actual string to a name() function.

[11:41.12] <haneefmubarak> yep np what's your project btw?
[11:41.30] <nitrxgen> oh look, i just used date() on some other server and it screams Warning: date(): It is not safe to rely on the system's timezone settings. You are *required* to use the date.timezone setting or the date_default_timezone_set() function. In case you used any of those methods and you are still getting this warning, you most likely misspelled the timezone identifier. We selected the timezone 'UTC' for now, but please
[11:41.31] <nitrxgen> set date.timezone to select your timezone. in /home/dev/prog.php on line 9

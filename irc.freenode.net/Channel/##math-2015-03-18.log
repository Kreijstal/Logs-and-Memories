[04:41.23] <Ploppz> I'm also confused because N∩S consists of Q so that g(Q) = 0, but a necessary condition is that all partial derivatives of g(Q) are not 0 when Q is in N∩S..?

[05:00.06] <Ploppz> hm I guess you can say that this defintion defines S as all points Q in N in which g(Q) = 0, so yeah

[05:01.17] <lyxia> yes
[05:01.25] <signalsea> Hi. What does it mean when one says the Cramer-Rao inequality applies to estimations of parameters T s.t. T does not appear in the _limits_ of the distribution?

[05:17.47] <Ploppz> say you have a parametric curve r(t). You can say that ∂r/∂t = change in r per unit t. Can you say that ∂r/∂t dt = change in r per dt?

[05:22.11] <Ploppz> fattest: first make a vector of each of the two travels
[05:22.45] <Ploppz> 30 degrees north of east is pretty much just 30 degrees. southeast is -45 degrees.
[05:23.17] <Ploppz> how do you make a vector given length and direction?
[05:23.37] <Ploppz> (rhetorical question)
[05:23.45] * sheer_ (~textual@118.127.97.24) Quit (Client Quit)
[05:24.03] <Ploppz> unless I misunderstood "30 degrees north of east"
[05:24.17] <fattest> allow me to draw ghis out
[05:24.35] * nayfie (~nayfie@CPE-58-160-174-54.unqy1.fli.bigpond.net.au) has joined channel ##math
[05:27.05] <fattest> Ploppz: ＋＋http://i.imgur.com/0s9Uqcp.png，， ?
[05:27.44] <Ploppz> fattest: Yup, that's how I see it too
[05:27.45] * albert_ (~albert@222.90.34.143) Quit (Remote host closed the connection)
[05:28.04] <fattest> what do i do now ?
[05:28.30] <Ploppz> you can easily make a vector given angle and direction using cos and sin
[05:28.32] * cyborg-one (~cyborg-on@185.23.104.75) Quit (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
[05:29.09] <Ploppz> eh.. angle and length
[05:29.18] <Ploppz> [rcos(t), rsin(t)] where r is the length and t is the angle

[05:30.14] <fattest> we're trying to find the length of blue line right? ＋＋http://imgur.com/yaV3qk3，，
[05:31.00] <ramp> yo
[05:31.05] <ramp> anyone able to help with a status question
[05:31.41] * tjger (~tjger@89.248.172.148) has joined channel ##math
[05:31.58] <Ploppz> fattest: oh, yeah. given in direction and length that too
[05:33.05] <Ploppz> if you find the two black vectors, you can add them, which will produce the blue vector, and then you can find the length and direction of that vector.
[05:33.19] * Kingsquee (~kingsley@d154-20-148-78.bchsia.telus.net) Quit (Quit: Konversation terminated!)
[05:33.52] <fattest> do i have to find the magnitude of the 2 black vectors?
[05:34.10] <Ploppz> you already know the magnitude; 20 and 10 respectively
[05:34.15] * hunteriam (uid63798@gateway/web/irccloud.com/x-ubarwwtaapnkorbu) Quit (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
[05:34.33] * notpara (~para@213.187.75.26) has joined channel ##math
[05:34.33] <Ploppz> I meant you need to find the x and y representation of the vectors
[05:34.56] <fattest> ohh

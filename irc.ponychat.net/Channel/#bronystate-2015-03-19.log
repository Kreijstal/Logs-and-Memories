[02:39.33] <@Shizuka> will be honest, i want to see that
[02:39.39] <@Shizuka> looks silly and stupid like battleship
[02:39.50] <Serenity> That looks terrible
[02:39.52] <Chrysalis> Shizuka I enjoyed battleship
[02:39.55] <Serenity> and I wanna see it
[02:39.57] <Chrysalis> it was stupid and silly, but it was fun
[02:40.04] <Chrysalis> and pixels looks the same
[02:40.14] <@Shizuka> you have to give them major credit for actually fitting battleship into the movie
[02:40.14] <Serenity> I didn't like battleship
[02:40.15] <@Buytoast> it's going to be annoying as all hell since it'll have Sandler and James
[02:40.28] <Serenity> Best of the terrible films,
[02:40.33] <@Buytoast> probably playing the manchild card again
[02:41.01] <Chrysalis> I wonder if they actually got the real creator pacman
[02:41.03] <Goldframe> if it were more along the lines of wreck it ralph, I wouldn't mind watching it, but it doesn't really look like it
[02:41.13] <Serenity> "sumbodei anhhilaete dis stuopid thing!!11"
[02:41.15] <Serenity> lost it
[02:41.27] <Chrysalis> oh yeah
[02:41.39] <Chrysalis> aw they didnt get the ral thing
[02:41.41] <@Buytoast> it's something i can probably see myself seeing with my brother and/or cousin, but that's pretty much it
[02:41.43] <Chrysalis> they used a lookalike
[02:41.59] <@Shizuka> it looks so battleship-y
[02:42.00] <@Shizuka> i want it

[02:42.24] <@Shizuka> ＋＋https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ99AKelKzo，， here chat have some more daypay from shizu's point of view
[02:42.36] <@Shizuka> i can hear how stuffy i am today >_<
[02:42.49] <Chrysalis> need to do another multistream
[02:43.01] <Chrysalis> This cookoff went really well
[02:43.21] <Chrysalis> we still had 2 ammo bags unused and most of 2 still on the ground
[02:43.43] <Serenity> Oh god supersledge
[02:43.49] <Chrysalis> euch god i hate my voice
[02:43.56] <@Shizuka> i like supersledge ._.
[02:44.00] <Serenity> Litearlly can't not hear "ass titties ass and titties"
[02:44.04] <%alitex_phone> Shizuka: how have you been doing?
[02:44.07] <Chrysalis> oh wow
[02:44.13] <@Shizuka> not bad
[02:44.16] <%alitex_phone> Wow my phone lagged
[02:44.17] <@Shizuka> could always be better
[02:44.19] <Serenity> Chrysalis, Ikr, mine sounds like I'm trying to sound deep on the internet
[02:44.19] <Chrysalis> top gear news, the other 2 refuse to film without clarkson
[02:44.29] <Serenity> but that's just how my voice is
[02:44.41] <Chrysalis> Serenity i constantly sound like im on a respirator
[02:44.44] <@Shizuka> i think i'm quiet in the mix again
[02:44.45] <Chrysalis> and theres a hole in my throat
[02:45.02] <@Shizuka> i figure as long as people still say my voice passes i'm happy with it :P
[02:45.09] <@Shizuka> i'm not completely cringing at it anymore
[02:45.31] * frakturfreak1 is now known as frakturfreak
[02:45.43] <%alitex_phone> Shizuka: that vid has you voice in it?
[02:45.57] <@Shizuka> yup
[02:46.00] <%alitex_phone> Like real life?
[02:46.03] <@Shizuka> ja
[02:46.21] <%alitex_phone> I need to watch that when my internet can back up
[02:46.26] <@Shizuka> the voice changer thing i found a couple months ago is only good for cleaning it up, and i've practiced beyond needing it anyway
[02:46.34] <@Shizuka> can really only do so much with software
[02:46.41] <%alitex_phone> True
[02:46.41] <Serenity> just reposting for the hell ＋＋http://i.imgur.com/ZbXFY6G.jpg，，
[02:46.45] <Serenity> deathpistol
[02:46.59] <Chrysalis> that fire rate :O
[02:47.14] <Serenity> Chrysalis, Highest possible DPS in game :)
[02:47.24] <@Shizuka> macroblocking like hell but it was stable
[02:47.45] <@Shizuka> i need to get a better secondary
[02:47.53] <@Shizuka> p90 is nice but it's huge and runs out too fast to back up my sniper
[02:48.06] <Serenity> I'm still trying to find some damn stealth mods for my swedish K
[02:48.23] <Serenity> It's a direct upgrade to the MP5, but I don't have the mods for it yet
[02:49.01] <@Shizuka> i'll have to do some more recording as we do hoxbreak
[02:49.03] <Chrysalis> id rather put high damage round through a skulldozer
[02:49.13] <@Shizuka> i can't decide if i want to main the rattlesnake or the r93
[02:49.16] <Serenity> that pistol eats skulldozers for breakfast
[02:49.24] <Serenity> I reccomend Mosin
[02:49.28] <Chrysalis> my thanatos has them as a snack
[02:49.31] <Serenity> or the R93
[02:49.38] <Chrysalis> if im low health i can oneshot them now
[02:49.56] <Serenity> I can kill a skulldozer with a single clip with all headshots
[02:50.02] <Serenity> And a greendozer with all bodyshots
[02:50.13] <@Shizuka> i'm doing really good with the rattlesnake but the penetration on shields feels really weak
[02:50.15] <Chrysalis> basically, dozers are nothing anymore
[02:50.29] <Chrysalis> Shizuka yeah most of the snipers need headshots to get sheilds
[02:50.30] <@Shizuka> but i love that i can shoot through the armored door through a shield through his head and the guy behind him on hoxbreak
[02:50.46] <Serenity> Rattlesnake does 74 headshot damage to a shield
[02:50.47] <@Shizuka> and they just stand there staring at the door like wtfhax
[02:51.04] <Serenity> obviously more with mods
[02:51.09] <Goldframe> I'm running the r93 and I'm lucky if I can get a clean headshot on the shield tbh

[02:51.22] <Serenity> Mark said shield and then it makes it a piece of piss
[02:51.23] <@Shizuka> thanatos has so little ammo i can't bring myself to use it
[02:51.35] <@Shizuka> five round clip plus long reload is painful
[02:51.45] <Chrysalis> Shizuka i dont tend to run low on ammo, unless we are hold up like in cookoff
[02:51.53] <Serenity> I reload my pistolthan less than a second
[02:51.59] <Chrysalis> got the skill perk to boost ammo pickup
[02:52.04] <Chrysalis> and never had any issues
[02:52.21] <Serenity> and I don't worry about ammo pools because I'll be the one blazing through crowds getting ammo where you people wouldn't dare go
[02:53.10] <@Shizuka> so once you're at 100 xp is worthless right?
[02:53.12] <Chrysalis> thats because you run a cheese build
[02:53.13] <Serenity> ya
[02:53.18] <Chrysalis> Shizuka yup
[02:53.21] <@Shizuka> lame
[02:53.29] <Serenity> As a quake player, my build is great
[02:53.32] <Chrysalis> well, i think it still converts to perk deck
[02:53.33] <@Shizuka> cause hate the slog from 60 back to 90-100
[02:53.50] <Serenity> It still converts to perk deck, but there's nothing good
[02:53.54] * pony_12345 (gmarxtolgf@203.87.lql.iim) has joined channel #bronystate
[02:53.57] <Serenity> I got like 60-75k perk points saved up
[02:54.02] <@Shizuka> pretty much stick to rogue for loud and burglar for stealth
[02:54.14] <@Shizuka> rogue's weapon switch time is nice, reminds me of degreaser pyro :P
[02:54.31] <Serenity> You use rogue, but not the 2 piece suit?
[02:55.01] <@Shizuka> cause not nimble enough :P
[02:55.14] <Serenity> You can dodge while stood still
[02:55.18] <@Shizuka> don't like being so squishy
[02:55.25] <Serenity> Ah fairysnuff
[02:55.38] <@Shizuka> so run the heavy ballistic, get a buff to armor making it equal to whatever the next one up is
[02:55.38] <Serenity> I'm not that bad, but if I'm shot by a sniper, I'm buggered
[02:55.42] <@Shizuka> without movement penalty and such
[02:56.00] <@Shizuka> because naturally as the girl of the group i am required by gaming law to have less physical armor coverage :P
[02:56.17] <Serenity> it's not a fantasy game
[02:56.20] <Serenity> so we're good
[02:56.50] <Serenity> and Paydays like the only game where the women aren't oversexualised, and it's hilarious how butthurt about that people are
[02:57.13] <@Shizuka> sumi totally needs to switch to bonnie, between us and hox we can bad accent everything up :P
[02:57.34] <@Sumica> already did
[02:57.39] <@Shizuka> dragan, clover, bonnie, hox, the unintelligible payday gang :P
[02:57.54] <[]DeadpoolDash> Yeah I run Hox too
[02:58.04] <Chrysalis> i still love dragan
[02:58.11] <Serenity> There's suddenly a million Brits in PD now
[02:58.30] <@Shizuka> is funny how none of us use dallas
[02:58.52] <Serenity> Dallas is the leaderfigure of the payday gang, but also the most boring
[02:59.12] <Serenity> Rip off is meh now, Chains is cool I like chains, Wolf is meh
[02:59.20] <Chrysalis> Serenity and theyre actually using DECENT accents
[02:59.24] <Goldframe> I tend to use Wick
[02:59.33] <Chrysalis> the bonnie actually sounds like a scottish lass i know
[02:59.37] <Serenity> I played Wick for a while before I got Hoxton
[02:59.47] <Serenity> All Scottish women sound the same though lol
[02:59.59] * Brad[Laptop] (Bradd@e887-842-87-109.bchsia.telus.net) Quit (Quit: Computer has gone to sleep.)
[03:00.15] <Goldframe> Serenity: do they all want to scorch yer nuts off?
[03:00.17] <Serenity> the difference being the strength of their already incohrent accent
[03:00.24] <@Shizuka> wick's not bad, and everyone has the proper callouts for him
[03:00.36] <Serenity> shame he's not voiced by Keanu reeves
[03:00.45] <Goldframe> yeah....that would've been nice
[03:00.50] <Serenity> but the voice style is pretty much spot on
[03:01.01] <Serenity> The VA nailed Keanu's emotion range
[03:01.04] <@Shizuka> he needs a "whoa"
[03:01.13] <Serenity> He does
[03:01.16] <[]DeadpoolDash> I know Kung Fu
[03:01.23] <Serenity> one of his callouts is "WOAH, snipah!"
[03:01.40] <Goldframe> I'm still shocked that John Wick was a really good film
[03:01.40] <@Shizuka> though i hear the movie is really good, i'll have to pick it up
[03:02.01] <@Shizuka> spose you figure, take the matrix, remove all the pretentious philosophy
[03:02.02] <[]DeadpoolDash> I hear a sequel is in the works
[03:02.05] <Goldframe> it is
[03:02.47] <Goldframe> and shizu...it's a really dark film, even by Keanu Reeves movie standards
[03:02.52] <[]DeadpoolDash> Overkill is making a Walking Dead game too.
[03:02.53] * alitex_phone (texasboykc@vampire.fruit.bat.nest) Quit (Quit: out!)
[03:03.00] <Serenity> Did they film it at night time or something?
[03:03.01] <@Shizuka> anyway alitex_phone all the videos more recent than the elite run have me talking
[03:03.03] <Serenity> *sitcom laughter*

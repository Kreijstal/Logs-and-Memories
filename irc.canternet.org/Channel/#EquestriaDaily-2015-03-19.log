[02:38.50] <Twilight_Shimmer> ?
[02:38.52] <@Mike_Coltfield> I can't quantify it, but it's just faster and things are less crashy
[02:39.02] <Twilight_Shimmer> im still using vista

[02:39.20] <Twilight_Shimmer> ive never had any troubles with it
[02:39.20] <@Mike_Coltfield> Also, Cortana is...a smidge more useful
[02:39.28] * Stradiverra (Stradiverra@TheMochaPony) Quit (Connection closed)
[02:39.38] <@Mike_Coltfield> And remember folks: Windows 7 == Windows Vista with a different taskbar
[02:39.44] <GypsyBelle> Then again, I saw that because I'm always on trash hardware and can't spare the memory for a post-XP windows version.
[02:39.47] <Twilight_Shimmer> that HAS to be a Halo reference
[02:40.46] <@Mike_Coltfield> I just asked her "Where is Master Chief."
[02:41.06] <@Mike_Coltfield> Her response was "Hopefully getting some R&R. He has saved the galaxy three or four times. The guy needs a vacation."
[02:41.36] <Twilight_Shimmer> Seriously?
[02:41.53] <@Mike_Coltfield> Well, yeah.
[02:42.05] <@Mike_Coltfield> It's not all that surprising, considering some of Siri's answers to things
[02:42.11] <@Mike_Coltfield> "I need to hide a body." "What? Again?"
[02:42.19] <Twilight_Shimmer> lol
[02:42.38] * Stradiverra (Stradiverra@TheMochaPony) has joined channel #EquestriaDaily
[02:42.38] * ChanServ sets mode +h Stradiverra for #EquestriaDaily
[02:42.40] <GypsyBelle> Except Siri doesn't have that one preprogrammed.
[02:42.41] <RiskyHiatusGuy> feisty I like
[02:42.44] <@Mike_Coltfield> "What are you wearing?" "Why does everyone keep asking me that?"
[02:43.32] <KilgoreTrout> Is it already stable?
[02:43.41] <KilgoreTrout> Also: can it be installed without a format?
[02:44.43] <GypsyBelle> Installed without a format?
[02:45.05] <RiskyHiatusGuy> I'm heading to sleep; night pones
[02:45.30] * Sleepykitty is now known as Unixkitty
[02:46.22] <KilgoreTrout> I would like to upgrade my system without having to back up insane amounts of data stored all over the hard drive
[02:46.30] <KilgoreTrout> it's a two day job to go through all that
[02:46.36] <KilgoreTrout> and I'm a parent
[02:47.46] <Endien> parenthood really makes one appreciate simple, easy solutions...
[02:47.57] <GypsyBelle> Oh, I'm following now. I don't know for sure, but usually windows stuff isn't naturally spread across partitions so it probably would end up killing data.
[02:48.13] <GypsyBelle> Someone who's actually done it might have a better answer though.
[02:49.37] <KilgoreTrout> My answer to "Will you assemble your own computer from parts" is "I don't even USE a computer back home"
[02:49.45] <KilgoreTrout> I do EVERYTHING with my phone
[02:49.58] <KilgoreTrout> If it can't be done with a phone, it will not be done
[02:50.55] * Stradiverra is now known as Syrena
[02:52.44] <GypsyBelle> I wouldn't use a phone for computing even if I could afford one. There's just something nice about a tower and a keyboard to me.
[02:53.06] <KilgoreTrout> I do my computing pretty much at work
[02:53.15] * Evil_Spike (EvilSpike@Pony-kllb6r.e-wire.net.au) Quit (Connection closed)
[02:53.17] <Endien> KilgoreTrout: Exactly!
[02:53.36] <KilgoreTrout> I ordered the FUNKOH LUUUUNA yesterday at work
[02:53.46] <Endien> Which is sort of a sad state, really, for a hacker. Then again I get to hack at work, so...
[02:53.55] <KilgoreTrout> It was THE LAST ONE in Finland
[02:54.04] <KilgoreTrout> and, as it seems, in the world.
[02:54.59] * TApple20 (Keenan@Pony-bj9qhi.bchsia.telus.net) has joined channel #EquestriaDaily
[02:55.10] <KilgoreTrout> I have an extra raspberry pi at work. I'm thinking web server which I can use to irc from everywhere. Possibly also a bot to play around with irc coding.
[02:55.32] <GypsyBelle> Ooh, those are nice little machines.
[02:55.38] <GypsyBelle> I really should find a use for mine.
[02:56.12] <KilgoreTrout> You could use it as a some sort of a media center
[02:56.40] <KilgoreTrout> If you LOVE coding, you could make a web-app which makes your smartphone the remote
[02:56.56] <Endien> Actually, you don't even have to love coding to do that. :/
[02:57.16] <KilgoreTrout> I guess there are ready-made software for that.
[02:57.37] <Endien> I use a Pi for that at home. It was awfully easy to set up.
[02:57.39] <Endien> Well, to a hacker.
[02:57.48] <ProjectCarthage> Does anyone know the difficulty of hacking Gameboy Color roms?
[02:58.02] <ProjectCarthage> I had another possible idea for something and I want to see if it works
[02:58.21] <KilgoreTrout> I guess they're assembly like nes
[02:58.38] <ProjectCarthage> I know this is a bit random,but the hack i have in mind is MLP Related
[02:58.45] <Endien> Just install OSMC on the Pi, and use an XBMC remote like Yatse on your phone to control it.
[02:59.20] <KilgoreTrout> I was just thinking how I could make one myself with a web server :D
[02:59.39] <KilgoreTrout> Python would be the obvious and easy choice to run scripts from a web page
[02:59.43] <ProjectCarthage> The main idea is to make a sortof Ponymon hack (Like the GBA ones), but with Gold and Silver
[03:00.37] <Endien> If you install a YouTube plugin, with Yatse on your phone you can even share directly from YouTube app to the Yatse, to open the clip directly on your media center
[03:01.16] <Schism> No offense, but just wondering, are you a big-Endien or a little-Endien?
[03:01.31] * Endien is little Endien.
[03:02.00] <GypsyBelle> :)
[03:02.25] <Schism> Hee.  Glad to see someone who appreciates an obscure programming joke.
[03:04.12] *** Server disconnected on irc.canternet.org

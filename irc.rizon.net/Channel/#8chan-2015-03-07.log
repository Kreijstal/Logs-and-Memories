[12:45.00] <+notAfads_> drwho thinking he made his own ideas, do you even utopia?
[12:45.00] <Tacomelt> christianity is a death worshiping cult, and islam is a forced conversion religion through death
[12:45.00] * qqK (~qqK@enton.rnull.org) Quit (Quit: Bouncers suck.)

[12:45.10] <Revan24> ＋＋http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism，，
[12:45.13] <Tacomelt> both are anti progress and science
[12:45.14] <xdus> Tacomelt christianity and islam are branches of judaism

[12:45.19] * matchen (willer@Rizon-09C2F5E.tisdip.tiscali.de) has joined channel #8chan
[12:45.20] <+TheBaconFromHell> idk... the video should of explained it to you...
[12:45.22] <Megasilver> I'm still wondering why not use the term omegas, considering they're on the bottom of the chain in a pack.
[12:45.25] <%Monroe> >'her'
[12:45.41] <xdus> when people mention the major religions they always say "christianity, judaism, islam etc"
[12:45.51] <+TheBaconFromHell> you obviously didnt watch it all Megasilver. I was watching with.
[12:45.52] <xdus> forgetting that they're all branches of judaism
[12:45.53] <Megasilver> Omegas are considered the pussiest of the pussies, no?  Especially since they're always following the fucking leader.  You know?
[12:45.54] <Tacomelt> both worship the paranoid schizophrenic voices of Abraham 
[12:46.01] <Tacomelt> yes xdus
[12:46.02] <Revan24> Judaism is probably the best Abrahamic religion to be honest.
[12:46.07] * The_Race_Realist (~qwebirc@BFF8F802.F5B297F4.4F329BA7.IP) Quit (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[12:46.07] <Revan24> Not saying much though.
[12:46.14] <gnostikoi> Megasilver a beta is a camel, an alpha is a lion, to put it in Nietzschen terms
[12:46.19] <+TheBaconFromHell> omegas are the ones that dont get pussy
[12:46.27] <xdus> Revan24 probably. at least the jews control the world
[12:46.29] <gnostikoi> > when people mention the major religions they always say "christianity, judaism, islam etc"
[12:46.30] <+TheBaconFromHell> so they are never worried about the shackles
[12:46.34] <%Monroe> Islam is the best religion - I'm a Muslim.
[12:46.39] <+anon517> smells like fedoras
[12:46.43] <Megasilver> Ok.
[12:46.49] <Megasilver> So what separates a beta from an omega?
[12:46.53] <Tacomelt> if someone claims to hear the voice of god today they receive treatment
[12:47.04] <%Monroe> I'm a Muslim, SJW, cuck and feminist.
[12:47.06] <Revan24> Isn't an Omega like a Wizard?
[12:47.07] <gnostikoi> that's bc the Abrahamic religions are a plot to enslave the Earth/Gaia
[12:47.13] <gnostikoi> ye Revan24 
[12:47.13] <+TheBaconFromHell> yeah its wizard

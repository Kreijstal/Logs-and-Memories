[12:03.32] <ra4king> "Much of the secularism and rationalism of our times dismisses the Christian view and teaching about heaven as "nothing more than hopeful thinking." But the Christian's promised hope of future blessedness is founded upon the fullest and plainest revelations of the Old and New Testaments. That it accords with the most sacred yearnings of the human breast does not weaken it, but serves rather to confirm the truth of it, since the One who made the heart 
[12:03.32] <ra4king> might be expected also to make provision for the fulfillment of its deepest longings."
[12:04.06] <ra4king> Translation: God made the heart and the heart longs for God therefore Christianity is true
[12:04.07] <ra4king> wtf
[12:04.14] <ra4king> the most bullshit argument I've ever read
[12:05.26] <@ChemicalSerenity> "... [T]he One who made the heart might be expected also to make provision for the fulfillment of its deepest longings."  So there's provision for drunken daddy raping twincest in the church? That's cool.

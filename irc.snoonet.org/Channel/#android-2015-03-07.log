[01:41.33] <Snoo31835> baconrules21: Hi, thanks for the response! Where can I find it in the settings? I have gone through all the browser settings and I am not seeing it..
[01:41.37] <Uzi> i was watching a livestream and fall asleep and when i woke up i had that problem
[01:41.45] <Uzi> so when i try to charge it
[01:41.49] <Uzi> its not working
[01:42.17] <baconrules21> Snoo31835: which one are you trying to enable? a desktop? You gotta enable it from the device you wnat the history to show I TINK
[01:42.27] <baconrules21> Uzi: turn it off and let it charge for like 30-40 minutes
[01:42.59] <Uzi> the phone is off and when i put the charger in it automaticly tries to turn on
[01:43.12] <baconrules21> just let it charge
[01:43.13] <baconrules21> for 30 minutes
[01:43.15] <Snoo31835> baconrules21: I am trying to enable the sync on my phone. So that it just syncs everything from my desktop. It works with the Chrome app, but not the default browser.Thanks.
[01:43.17] <baconrules21> plug it in and let it go for 30-40 minutes
[01:43.39] <baconrules21> Snoo31835: Oh it only works with chrome as far as I know
[01:44.12] <Snoo31835> I can't sync with the default browser? :( Chrome is so choppy for me.
[01:44.13] <Uzi> yea but its like LG logo black or blue screnn Lg logo black or blue screen and again
[01:45.15] <Uzi> and i dont know what to do
[01:45.45] <baconrules21> Uzi: Dude, just let it sit there for 30 -40 minutes
[01:45.58] <baconrules21> Snoo31835: really? Even on G2?
[01:46.05] <Uzi> but the phone is getting hot like shit
[01:46.14] <baconrules21> Then i have no idea
[01:46.20] <baconrules21> take out the battery and put it back in
[01:46.31] <Snoo31835> baconrules21: I am on a S3 running CM12. Stock browser has beautiful, smooth animations. Chrome is hideous haha
[01:46.32] <baconrules21> or try a differnet outlet
[01:46.33] <baconrules21> idk
[01:46.55] <Uzi> outlet?
[01:46.59] <baconrules21> Snoo31835: ah make sense I guess but Stock doens't support it unfortunatly
[01:47.02] <baconrules21> Socket
[01:47.41] <Snoo31835> baconrules21: Alright, thanks for the help! Any suggestions on a quick browser that has Chrome sync?
[01:48.01] <baconrules21> I think its propriatary to chrome honestly
[01:48.13] <baconrules21> I dont think you want other apps being able to get your browising history lol

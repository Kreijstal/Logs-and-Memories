[02:43.25] <Rainb> I used to had hexchat
[02:43.27] <Rainb> but in windows
[02:43.31] <Rainb> it crashes errytiem
[02:43.48] <Rainb> so then I passed to xchat-2 per suggestion
[02:43.54] <Rainb> it worked for like 4 months
[02:44.08] <Rainb> but then there was a bug that crashed everytiem it joined some channel or something
[02:44.37] <nik> maybe try hexchat again?
[02:44.53] <Rainb> But I did, it still krashed

[02:46.35] <Rainb> I know people still suggest mirc cause even though is not foss, it is stable and crap
[02:46.57] <Rainb> also I've thought about making my own or something, but that would just be too much work
[02:47.08] <Rainb> well, more work than I'm willing to do anyway.
[02:48.18] <nik> try x86 version if you used x64
[02:48.25] <Rainb> Hmm

[06:15.40] <Tangaloa> yfw aviation uses a clusterfuck of both
[06:15.49] <sperger> in fact, i made these burgers solely because i didn't have any not boring idea
[06:16.56] <sperger> so they really should reconstruct this system because amerifats units aren't something that should be used in any kind of navigation

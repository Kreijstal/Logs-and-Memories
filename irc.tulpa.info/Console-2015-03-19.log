[02:36.25] --InfoServ-- *** Message(s) of the Day ***
[02:36.25] --InfoServ-- [Invites] Notice from DPR, posted 02:01 on 05/23/2014:
[02:36.25] --InfoServ-- We've been receiving a lot of reports about unsolicited channel invite spam. If you get any unsolicited invitations to a channel, please let a member of network staff know in #help or via PM.
[02:36.25] --InfoServ-- [Agape Retirement] Notice from Quora, posted 04:20 on 04/10/2014:
[02:36.25] --InfoServ-- The node agape.tulpa.info has relayed its last message today. It has been a part of our network since day 1 back in June of 2013. If you had previously hardcoded your client to connect there, please take if off your server list and instead connect to irc.tulpa.info.
[02:36.25] --InfoServ-- [Vhost Timing] Notice from Quora, posted 20:20 on 02/24/2014:
[02:36.25] --InfoServ-- The delay between vhost requests has now been changed to 2 weeks (14 days). The rules against using vhost changes to evade bans or quiets are still in effect. If you have any questions about this change or the vhost policy, please ask in #help.
[02:36.25] --InfoServ-- [Quiet mode] Notice from Heartmender, posted 03:32 on 12/16/2013:
[02:36.25] --InfoServ-- TulpaInfo supports what is called a channel quiet list. To use this, set mode +q the same way you would set a ban. People matching a quiet will be able to join and part channels, but not change their nickname or speak unless they have voice. This means you can quiet individual people without having to voice everyone and mute the room.
